## Permaculture_patterning

Both permaculture and pattern design are conscious approach to design living systems.

### Permaculture design: 
Start with elements (parts)
assemble them
into a whole

This is a process of starting with parts then creating wholes by addition.

### Patterning (Alexander)

start with a whole ...
differentiate it ...
into parts ...

This is a process of starting with wholes then creating parts by differentiation.

### Start with mainframe

Roads, water structure, 

### Analysis

### Permaculture Criteria for connections

“Highest use tells us how to connect design elements or activities in time by linking their functions or uses in a sequence. It tells us what to do first.”

“Needs and resources analysis tells us how to connect the parts of a design to one another.”

“The zone system organizes the parts of the design in relation to the user or center of use.”

“Sector analysis organizes design elements into useful relationships with outside influences that we cannot directly affect.”

## Darren Doherty sequence for plans making

From more permanent (difficult to change/affect) to less permanent (easier to affect/change)

### 1) Google Earth

Google Earth photo data is getting better all of the time and it is a blessing to have it available. We use Google Earth Pro, NearMap & other services to obtain high quality images and then use ‘Grab’ or similar apps to take higher resolution screen shots and then use Photoshop’s ‘Photomerge‘ tools to assemble a very high quality mosaic as we have done in this case, making sure that each ‘Grab’ has sufficient overlap to allow the photo merge possible

### 2) The Cadastral Layer

The cadastral layer identifies the legal title boundaries which is important to know, particularly if the client has it in their mind to subdivide the property in future and will want the landscape plan to reflect that potential.

### 3) Topographic Map

A topographic map is necessary for us to analyse the landform and help us develop plans that ‘bring water under control‘ (P.A. Yeomans) as when we do that we can develop reliable and profitable agricultural ecologies. Ideally we would have 0.5-1.0m contour maps however they are not always available due to their relatively high cost to the farmer (AUD$8+/hectare).

### 4) Water Storage

After calculating the number of livestock that will be able to be sustained (including projected improvements in carrying capacity) on this parcel we then work out how much water is needed in storage, making allowances for unreliable rain and dry years that are a regular feature of South Eastern Australia. With the advent of plastic pipe we are able to deliver water very efficiently by gravity after a windmill pumps water to an elevated header tank. Today’s powerful bulldozers with hydraulic rippers and tilting hydraulic blades can build deep dams (4-6m+) with a minimum of surface area thereby reducing evaporation considerably over shallow dams with large surface areas. 1:1 internal batters are also feasible largely because livestock are fenced out as they get their water from portable troughs fed by the gravity-fed pipe network.

### 5) Water Harvesting

After siting dams high in the landscape we usually need to increase their catchment. This provides for increased storage reliability which is of course critical to the success of an enterprise that needs water for livestock and other purposes. Consideration of reduced runoff due to improved land management practices (increasing the water cycle) also comes into play and further increases the need for catchment devices. These 1:400 gradient drains will harvest overland flow from summer storms when the ground is naturally dry and harder and in autumn-spring when field capacity is reached.

### 6) Calculating Catchment

Its important as part of the process of scoping out water harvesting & storage projects to ensure that what you think will work will actually work. That’s why Regrarians applies a 5 step process of due diligence before building any dam, including catchment analysis to determine the volumes of run off available to a proposed site.


### 7) Irrigation

Irrigation reticulation pipe is best laid on ridges to allow for maximum coverage of foothills landscapes. Other elements such as farm roads, trees and fencing then follow these water lines as conduits of flow & subdivision. This pattern ensures that you always know where the pipes are and always will even if the land changes hands!


### 8) Access

Access is critical on any property and especially where multiple visits are required to livestock or other farm systems. Keyline water planning determines the placement of roads to follow that of water systems, in this case the piped reticulation system. Like water pipe, farm roads should ideally be central to service as much land as possible, be in a loop and be on the apex of ridges to reduce slope, erosion, earthworks and permit maximum vision to the landscape under management.

### 9) Headlands

Headlands are necessary for any project layout to provide for vehicle turning be it a wheel barrow or 30′ header! Keyline cultivation patterns are also the guide for the placement of parallel rows of trees in either wide spacing (eg. 60m x 60m ‘Grassy Woodland/Dehesa) or contiguous rows or belts.

### 10) Forestry

Various forestry systems are integrated in with the headlands offsets & Keyline guidelines restricting the extent of these systems. Placement of respective systems is determined by the distance from the yards along with solar access, wind direction and client discussions.

## A default sequence adopted then adapted from P. A Yeomans’ Scale of Permanence:

- Climate (including the personal and cultural climate) – which Darren calls the rules of the game
- Geography – Which Darren summarises as the board on which the game is played
- Water
- Access
- Forestry
- Buildings
- Fencing
- Soils
- Marketing (added by Darren)
- Energy (added by Darren)

> comment: where does vision/strategic plan fit in that sequence ? Robyn francis does it early, see below.

## Robyn Francis sequence

- First get the big picture patterns in context – starting from bioregion and neighbourhood (geo-physical & social patterns, I’ve developed my own ESM tool for this), and 
- clarify the strategic plan (vision, aims, objective, values). 
- Then the patterning more immediate external influences (sector analysis) and mapping the patterns within the site itself (site analysis). Here I find Ian McHarg’s exclusion overlay process particularly useful as a tool for mapping the ‘higher order’ ecological needs of the site (I call this “listening to the land”) plus other restraints (buffer zones, legislative, planning), which then provides a context to move into conceptual bubble planning, functional analysis, flow patterns & analysis, which lead into spacial patterns and relationship between systems (zonation), 
- then last, but not least the placement and patterning of the individual elements as the design details. 
- Assembling or patterning the relationship of the elements always come last and within the context of the big-picture patterns.

## Dan Palmer's proposed Permaculture Design process

- Starting with an existing configuration of a whole-space-comprising-a-configuration-of-already-differentiated-parts…
- …further differentiating this whole…
- …fluidly moving down, up, and sideways as necessary…
- …both modifying what is there and conceiving (as potential) then introducing (as actual) new parts…
- …that grow out of and hence harmonise with the whole…
- …to support the evolution of that whole…
- …as a rich network of interelated parts…
- …toward our desired outcomes of a resilient, abundant, human-supporting ecosystem (or whichever wording floats your boat).



## Permaculture patterning sequence

Draft by Lilian.

### start with an ethical framework
- work to preserve and nourrish life in all its form

### Change your view of the world 

- Shift focus from object to relationship by using the centers/pattern lens to look at the world
- Change your view of order: accept unpredictability and emergence
- shift your focus from quantitative to qualitative assessment

#### Always be aware of the whole

- rely on your intuition and feeling as a tool to comprehend the wholeness of systems
- feel the wholeness at all levels (the response to the land… must be rooted, always in the whole, in the cultural and human whole and the land and the ecological and natural wholeness of that place which forms the context of our work (Alexandeer, 2002b, p. 344)
- feel the latent potential of the system: what is its exsiting dynamics, where does it want to go, what wants to emerge ?

#### Shift your process 
- from a descriptive to a generative approach, 
- from assembling process to differentiating process
- a living structure can only arise from a truly living process

### Map what is already there and work creativelly to preserve and extend it

- Create new links between centers so that they support each others
- Work by step-by-step adaptation using feedback at each step
- Start by design mainframe first then go into details (move from pattern to details)
- Shift your focus from whole to parts then back to whole
