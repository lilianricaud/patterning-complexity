# Centers

Centers can be seen as discernable subunit of a system (at various scale of any system - HIERARCHY)

Alexander use the term centers instead of PATTERNS in his latest work to show living systems have more centers and more links between centers.

see the difference between centers and patterns (lilianricaud/patterns/Pattern_Research/comparing-patterns-vs-centers.md)

HOLONS seems to be a similar concept, but Alexander have gone further in the application of centers for design/patterning.
