# Deep feeling

Alexander, Otto Scharmer (and permaculture to a degree) all recommend to use feeling to understand a system.

It might be because a system can be so complex that using only our logical mind, we don't have access to all the variables, whereas using all our body and mind intuition, we tap into a deeper form of intelligence.

Alexander devised a test to assess what are the most living structures and transformations.
