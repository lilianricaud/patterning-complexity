# Generative sequence / Sequence of unfolding

The sequence is organized so that the form unfold coherently, and allow all the necessary PATTERNS to appear in the finished structure.

Traditional sequence also created the form, geometry, style so that the whole had deep coherence.

Tribal society used generative sequence to build: for example in the pacific island, oral societies used song to map the different step to build a canoo:
- go to the forest
- find a certain kind of tree with certain kind of dimensions
- cut it down
- dig the inside
- make the front beatiful
- ...

The sequence can be followed by almost anyone and lead to a successful construction at the end.

Molisson reports tribal used songs in a similar way to encode sequence for navigating the land (aborigenes) or the ocean (polynesia).

Cooking recipes can be seen as generative sequence for making food, with various recipes using various ingrdeients/patterns and reaching certain kind of patterns at end (SWEET/SOUR, FRESH HERBS/COCONUT SAUCE...)
