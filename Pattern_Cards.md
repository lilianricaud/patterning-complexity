Pattern languages are useful tools but because of their non-linear nature, they are not easy to manipulate in a linear book format. 

Therefore, 

Embed the patterns on cards that can be manipulated individually and combined as required.

For that, place the core of the pattern (problem and solution) on the back of a small card, with the name and an illustration on the front to make the card unique and distinguishable. Provide a way to find more detailled instructions about the pattern such as pattern source and number (or a QR code to link to a web ressource). 

Make printed cards only when you are sure you won't need to change the pattern, but while you mine the pattern make cards that are written with a pencil so you can refine the pattern as you use it.
