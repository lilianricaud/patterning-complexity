# Quality without a name

"Alive, whole, comfortable, free, egoless, eternal" cannot be defind precisely, always different yet objective quality.

Subtle kind of freedom from inner contradictions.

Difference between:
- health / sickness 
- wholeness / dividedness
- self-maintainance / self-destruction

In a world which is alive, whole, healthy, people themselves can be alive and self-creating.

Subtle harmony between various forces of a (sub-)system, synergy where the forces/energies are used productivelly by the system leading to generative behaviors and not (self) destructuve behaviors.

in tune with inner forces (fire, tiger, symphony...)

needs to be created with abandon.

circular: when it is around we can have it, when we have it we can generate it.
