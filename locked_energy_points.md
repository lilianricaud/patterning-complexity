# Locked energy points

_This from Tom Atlee on social systems, but could be seen as accunpuncture and used for architectural or agricultural systems:_

Work with existing energies and unlock:
- where can suppressed passions be productively empowered ?
- where are key players embattled, overwhelmed, or uncoordinated, mired in situations which, if addressed well, would free up their life energy to make vital contributions ?
- what systemic issues are hot in the public mind, where attention could be shifted from complaining  and problem solving to systemic insight and transformation ?
- where is an issue or system reaching a crisis point or generating one or more trigger events such that the right questions and conversations could unleash a storm of high energy creative thinking and action ?
- what social systems - like political, economical, educationnal, and philantropic systems - and systems dynamics - like purpose, incentives and feedbacks - if successfully shifted could impact how the whole society behaved ?
