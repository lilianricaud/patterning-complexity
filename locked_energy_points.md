# Locked energy points

_This from Tom Atlee on social systems, but could be seen as accunpuncture and used for architectural or agricultural systems:_

Work with existing energies and unlock:
- where can suppressed passions be productively empowered ?
- where are key players embattled, overwhelmed, or uncoordinated, mired in situations which, if addressed well, would free up their life energy to make vital contributions ?
- what systemic issues are hot in the public mind
