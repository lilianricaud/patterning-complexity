# ANTIPATTERNS approach to pattern design

Approach tried by Douglas Schuler and Justin Wagaman

The Surprising Power, Vitality, and Potentiality of Examining the “ Dark
Side”
  
The Collaborative Production of the Restraining Voices Anti-Pattern
Language in an Educational Setting



In this project we actually tried to identify
commonplace phenomena that are encouraging
the degradation of the social and environmental
worlds that we live in.

The aim was not to create a
comic book filled only with one-dimensional
villains, but rather it was to create a set of
patterns that were often morally dubious but
realistic. The thought was that the more realistic
and detailed our analysis / portrayal was, the
easier it would be to develop a set of anti-anti-
patterns (traditional patterns) that is designed to
help counter the anti-patterns.

Liberating

Many of these patterns are enacted consciously,
with someone deciding to enact them, but many
more are carried out either without thought to the
consequence or the collective impact — no one
really sees the big picture until it is too late. This
is the value that became clear when we were
developing the anti-patterns. It shines a light on
the process that is happening and once it is fully
illuminated it is difficult to not see it everywhere.


With the Anti-Pattern project we realized fairly
early on that we should make it one of our top
priorities to not document them as if we think
they are “Bad.” Nor should we write them as if
they were “Good,” either. We tried to write them
in a neutral and informative style with as little
bias as possible regardless of our feelings toward
the various behaviors discussed in the patterns.
If someone wanted to try to recreate the Cultural
Imperialism pattern from our work, he or she
could play a role in perpetuating it.


### set of descriptors used for each pattern

These descriptors were: Description,
How it Works, Evidence, Linked Patterns, and
References.

### Mining Process

To create a first draft of this language within the
10-week quarter, we went through a process that
proceeded incrementally according to the
demands of the project at the time. We generated
lots of possible patterns, convened small and
large discussions, contributed to the project Wiki,
added descriptive images from the public domain,
and, finally, arranged, grouped, and categorized
the anti-patterns. 

<!--- Ultimately we identified three
fundamental anti-patterns, Civic Ignorance,
Violence, and Environmental Degradation, and
over 30 others, which we arranged roughly from
biggest to smallest, similarly to both of our model
pattern languages.
--->

We started by generating a large list of anti-
patterns in several group brainstorm sessions.
This list was whittled down over the course of the
next couple of weeks in seminar groups and
much discussion. To get the initial list of
approximation of one hundred patterns we voted
for our top ten patterns and kept the 35 most
popular as the first set. The patterns that made it
ran the gambit from more serious issues such as
Racism and Societal Apathy, humorous titles like
Weapons of Mass Distraction and more subtle
issues such as Focus on Deficiencies and Mock
Public Space
