# ANTIPATTERNS approach to pattern design

Approach tried by Douglas Schuler and Justin Wagaman

The Surprising Power, Vitality, and Potentiality of Examining the “ Dark
Side”
  
The Collaborative Production of the Restraining Voices Anti-Pattern
Language in an Educational Setting



In this project we actually tried to identify
commonplace phenomena that are encouraging
the degradation of the social and environmental
worlds that we live in.

The aim was not to create a
comic book filled only with one-dimensional
villains, but rather it was to create a set of
patterns that were often morally dubious but
realistic. The thought was that the more realistic
and detailed our analysis / portrayal was, the
easier it would be to develop a set of anti-anti-
patterns (traditional patterns) that is designed to
help counter the anti-patterns.

Liberating

Many of these patterns are enacted consciously,
with someone deciding to enact them, but many
more are carried out either without thought to the
consequence or the collective impact — no one
really sees the big picture until it is too late. This
is the value that became clear when we were
developing the anti-patterns. It shines a light on
the process that is happening and once it is fully
illuminated it is difficult to not see it everywhere.


With the Anti-Pattern project we realized fairly
early on that we should make it one of our top
priorities to not document them as if we think
they are “Bad.” Nor should we write them as if
they were “Good,” either. We tried to write them
in a neutral and informative style with as little
bias as possible regardless of our feelings toward
the various behaviors discussed in the patterns.
If someone wanted to try to recreate the Cultural
Imperialism pattern from our work, he or she
could play a role in perpetuating it.
