# FINDING PATTERNS FOR NEW DISCIPLINES 

A new discipline needs to abstract its patterns as they appear. It is building its own foundation and logical skeleton, upon which future growth can be supported. Knowing its basic patterns early on will speed up the language's development, and guide it in the right direction. 

**You may obtain insight into a new field lacking a pattern language by studying patterns from established disciplines.** A universal high-level structure is inherent in all pattern languages. 

The solution space, which is distinct from the parameter space, is rarely one-dimensional, which means that knowing what doesn't work cannot give what works simply by doing the opposite. 

There may be an infinity of different opposites. One needs to exhaust the solution space by identifying many neighbouring anti-patterns before zeroing in on the pattern itself. 

Here we need to warn against the destructive tendency in our times of judging patterns prematurely using strict criteria such as efficiency, cost reduction, and streamlining. It is not that these are inappropriate criteria, but rather that they tend to ignore the linkage between patterns. In other words, patterns in a pattern language depend on each other in a complex manner, and a hasty culling of what are erroneously deemed 'superfluous' patterns may damage the cohesion of the language. 

Many fundamental patterns have been discarded in the false interest of economy, without realizing that they are essential to a system's coherence and overall performance. The long-term consequences of this are negative, and significant. You may attempt to streamline a process after its complexity is well understood, but not before. 

Promising new patterns, and time-honoured old ones, have been ruthlessly scrapped by short-sighted thinking, borne out of the belief that complex systems have to conform to some sort of 'minimalist design'. This comes from a superficial understanding of how a system works. The most elegant complex systems are nearly (but not perfectly) ordered. 

Having to accommodate patterns on the smaller and intermediate scales - indeed, actually growing out of them - the larger- scale patterns cannot be perfect in the sense of being pure or too simple. Good design avoids unnecessary complication. It is balanced between arising out of loosely organized small-scale patterns, which could lead to somewhat random forms or processes, and patterns which might pay too much attention to the large scale. Going too far in either extreme damages the coherence (and therefore the efficiency) of the system.
