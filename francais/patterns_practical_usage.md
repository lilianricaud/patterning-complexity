# PATTERN PRACTICAL USAGE

how to utilize patterns in practice.  

A set of connected patterns provides a framework upon which any design can be anchored. The patterns do not determine the design. 

**By imposing constraints, they eliminate a large number of possibilities while still allowing an infinite number of possible designs. The narrowing of possibilities is, after all, an essential part of a practical design method.**

In practice, it is very cumbersome to work from a complete catalogue of discovered patterns to create a product. 

**A SIMPLIFIED CONNECTIVE LIST can drastically improve the utility of any pattern language**. A procedure for generating such a map is based on the conceptual 'chunking' of information (Miller, 1956). 

**The goal is to cluster patterns into groups of about five or fewer on each level of scale**.  Suppose one needs to design something using available patterns; pick those that are most relevant to the problem at hand, then choose not more than about a dozen related patterns from a n existing patterns catalogue. Identify a vertical dimension (e.g. time, space, or group size) appropriate to the process that generates the end product, and study how the generative process develops as one moves up the levels of scale.  Once you assemble a group of patterns from a patterns catalogue, you can go back and develop others for related processes, which will include patterns left out in the initial round. Pattern groups for different results should be separate, and not confuse each other's clarity.
