# PATTERNS VS OBJECTS

When we try to understand the complexity of the world using a cartesian approach we tend to see at the world as pieces, elements, objects...

This approach is useful for simple systems but as soon as we get into complex systems it lacks power.

A narrow-minded cartesians researcher trying to understand a tree might look at every single leaf as a different object and study every single leaf to get an understanding.

However if the researcher recognize that all leaves of the same tree or the same species share a common pattern, he can understand that they will all share the same global properties and won't have to study all of them.

Patterns therefore are a way reading and understand the complexity by singling out specific properties that are shared accross various systems.

For cartesians/mecanists mind the difficult thing is to recognize "objects" as such don't exist but are perceptible entities made of overlapping patterns and that the perceptability of these "objects" is entirely dependent on the perception mecanisms that are used.

In this context, similar "objects" are both the same (because they share the same broad patterns) and different (because their developmemnt led them to have different smaller patterns).
