# DISCHARGE PHENOMENA

Not only expansion but discharge phenomena such as lightning (or sudden shock in people) disrupt or triggers initiatory reactions in life rythms and introduce irregularities in CYCLES or PULSERS, just as expansion or shock introduces irregularities in fixed forms.

Question whether disturbance produced by shock or sudden stimulus is responsible for expansions, cyclic changes or shape deformations on a more general scale.

from Mollison, Permaculture, a designer's manual.
