# Difference between patterns and centers

Christopher Alexander originally talked about patterns then went on discussing centers. What are the links and difference between the two ?

## Patterns

Basic definition of a pattern is a recurring configuration characteristic of a particular system.

Alexander brought up pattern to a a design framework.

In Alexander's view, a pattern performs several functions :
- unit of recognition of form and inference
- a mental filter and differentiation framework
- a unit of representation of form
- an elementary unit of systemic fitness
- a connective building block
- a structured and connected object - unit of knowledge
- a boundary object for hermeneutic (interpretation) inquiry
- a mediative and connective object for systemic intervention.

Basically design patterns are a way to encapsulate  tacit knowledge in an interoperable format. Pattern languages bring to ligh knowledge and understanding about the system that is normally hidden from view and which, when consciouly articulated, allows people to propose and act upon to transform theur situation.

Therefore Patterns:
- reveal domain-specific tacit knowledge allowing to be understood, unpacked, and recomposed to address spcific challenges and needs
- build a language format upon which communities of practice can share experience
- facilitate socialization and recombination of knowledge (-> hyperproductive learning and knowledge creating communities).
- provide a conduit to externalize tacit knowledge (translation/transfer between domains)
- provide a web of "readable" possibilities people can explore
- articulate fundamental design principle to guide life serving application in a given domain
- allow users to explore, share, compare patterns and languages (codified tacit knowledge)

->pattern could help map practices and implicit knowledge in the same way the theory of information helped encode analogic information into digital information.


## Complex systems and centers

Complex systems can be decomposed partly into recognizable subsystems bound by strong forces (systemic patterns) inter-related through weaker links, which can be treated as recombinable units (the design patterns) within design models following grammar-like rules (Finidori et al). 

By making visible previously covert processes and the tacit knowledge that underlies them, a pattern language provides a common vocabulary for design.

## Difference between patterns and centers

If orignally Alexander used the term 'pattern' he used preferentially 'centers' later on.

A center can be seen as a distinguishable/identifiable part of a system (a window is a part of house, a river a part of valley).

At the same time each center is made up of smaller centers (a river is made up of the riverbed, the water, the trees nearby, ...).

Because systems are "hierarchical" (ie, systems are nested within bigger systems and made up of smaller systems), each 'part'/element/center/pattern is a whole in itself.

So a center can be seen as a 'systemic object' or element, ie not an object in the mecanistic point of view (a part isolated from the rest), but a subsystem always linked to the bigger whole.

It is important to understand that a center is not an isolated part but a subsystem always linked to the bigger system. where does the river stops ? at the water level ? at the edge of the river bed, but how far from the water level ? does it include the trees nearby ? It all depends on where/how we focus our attention and we'll have different definition if we are close to the river or looking at it from the sky.

A way of describing this is thinking of shining a torch at something at night, you can see a part in the light, but there aren't any strict boundaries or separation from the rest of the system.

In systems thinking a pattern is a recurring configuration characteristics of a particular system (all rivers are different, yet all have recurrent configuration, all oak trees are different, yet all have recurrent configuration that we can recognize).

In alexander view, a pattern is at the same an "element" described and a way of decribing the relationship of elements within that element. 

By describing accurately good (he calls them living) configurations, we effectivelly map a center and therefore make it explicit/visible (think again about the metaphor of a torch or a lens) therefore can act on it consciously individually or colectivelly.

_So a **center** can be seen as systemic object, a sub-system and a **pattern** as the careful description of this center._

Alexander argues that he devised this method to revive knowledge that was mostly implicit/unconscious in traditionnal cultures but is getting lost nowadays. By making knowledge explicit we can act on it, maintain it, pass it on, enrich it.

**Therefore a center/pattern is lens, a mapping tool for conscious design.**
