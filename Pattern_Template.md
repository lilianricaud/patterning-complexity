# Template V2.5

Most pattern template try to be exhaustive, but often the information is siloed within various sections (context, problem, solutions,) or try to be too detailled (describing wich forces are harmonized by the patterns). Since all context are different, it is better to have description that contains all this information then iterate. think about it more as a generated piece of art and not a fabricated object with a list of feature

The template below use all these ideas.

## Pattern Name

Short (1-3 words). Alexander doesn't use verbs générally. Why ?? Possibly because verbs are used to describe the relationship between patterns (ex: ROOF *sits above* the WALLS)

### Problem/context

Emphasize the situation where it is need/important. Leave out unnecessary details/informations

### Therefore, 

Small link

### Good practice

- short (5-10 lines)
- cane be written on a pattern card

## Additionnal information

Alexander wrotte a lot of information to give evidence about the effectiveness of a pattern

## Source
Where does the information described come from (personal experience, scientific data, ...)

## Related patterns
