# Objectivity vs Subjectivity

As Capra discussed the so-called objectivity of Cartesian science is an illusion and logic is not enough to understand systems.In cartesian paradigme, scientific descriptions are believed to be objective, ie independent of the human observer and the process of knowing. The new paradigm implies that epistemology - understanding of the process of knowing - has to be included explicitly in the description of natural phenomena.
