# Pattern Name

It seems Alexander used only nouns to name pattern in his language. I was wondering if there's a reason for that or if patterns could be named using verbs as some other authors have done to name their good practices in the pattern format.

Somewhere *towards the center* of a REGION there is a CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT, which contains a *very high desnsity* OFFICE BLOCK. The overall density of the region *slopes off with distance from the center according to exponential laws*; *periodically there are again peaks* of higher density and *subsidiary* to these *smaller peaks* are still smaller peaks. Each of these peaks of density *contains* STORES and OFFICES *surrounded by* higher density housing...
