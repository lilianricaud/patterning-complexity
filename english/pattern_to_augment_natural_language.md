# PATTERNS TO AUGMENT NATURAL LANGUAGE

pattern languages could be seen as a proto language, a systemic language, with more ‘performing’ or ‘systems behavior generating’ powers than natural spoken language, and with 
less assumed shared meaning. A sort of “perceptual code” used to describe, and simulate, if not enact, in adaptive ways,  the  systemic  workings  of  the  world,  bringing the  focus  on  processes  and  networks  of  complex  systems interrelationships and their manifestations, rather than on categories, and how things are named by convention.

Such approach would enable, as suggested by Henshaw 66 , to focus attention more directly on individual subjects and organizational designs of nature, and their overlaps, cross-linkages, and ambiguities, rather than on invented categories. Such pattern languages become a medium for systemic conversation and mediation, with patterns used as boundary objects or object of research within and across different interpretation and representation world

We can see patterns, in their broadest definitions, as units of ‘meaning-making’, which enable both the decoding (understanding), and the encoding (design or transformation) of systems characteristics, in a heuristic participative way.

from an epistemological perspective, Alexander did capture the multiple facets of patterns, and their systemic implication. But I contended that the execution or practice did not follow, because in  their  current  form,  patterns  and  pattern  languages  do  not  leverage  the  properties and  potential  of  patterns optimally. Indeed, patterns and pattern languages are not currently configured to be systemic. In other words, they are not fit methodologically for systemic design.
