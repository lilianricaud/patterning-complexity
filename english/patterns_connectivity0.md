# PATTERNS CONNECTIVITY

Connectivity between patterns  

Any perceived weakness of patterns could be in individual patterns, but it is more likely the result of not understanding their combinatorial language. Although design patterns written in Alexandrine form allude to their connectivity to other patterns (in the prelude and postscript), it is difficult to visualize those without a PATTERN CONNECTIVE MAP. 

Even architects who use patterns tend to be unaware of how patterns link to each other, so the resulting design frequently lacks large-scale coherence (PATTERN LANGUAGES STRUCTURAL COHERENCE).

To give readers a better sense of what is meant by patterns connecting to each other, we list some examples of coupling. 

- One pattern contains or generalizes another smaller-scale pattern. 
- Two patterns are complementary and one needs the other for completeness. 
- Two patterns solve different problems that overlap and coexist on the same level. 
- Two patterns solve the same problem in alternative, equally valid ways. 
- Distinct patterns share a similar structure, thus implying a higher-level connection.

With connective rules, two different aspects of a pattern come into play. 

On one hand, a pattern's internal components will determine its inclusion into a larger pattern. 

On the other hand, it is the interface that determines overlap, or connection on the same level. Two patterns on the same level may either compete, loosely coexist, or necessarily complement each other.
