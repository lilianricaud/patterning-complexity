Culture is a shared pattern among a group of people,it's a ste of habits that definesthe way we see things and the way we relate to one another.

In an organizatioin culture is the social infrastructure, the operating system, defines who talk to whom, who calls the shots.

Culture is all around us, it's something you feel when you turn one tv, when you go to work. It's everywhere. But because it's a set of habits it's invisible. Once it gets cultural, it's something you forget about very often and a great culture hacks change habits. 

it's going to change the way we relateto one another




 (based on “How to Become a Culture Hacker - Seb Paquet “) you’ll need to:

- Observe - Observe the culture and subcultures around you - what do you see? how does it affect you? where can you find opportunities to solve problems and promote change?
- Find the crack - A crack can be found in everything - ‘that’s how the light gets in’
Make art - Create something that has never been done.
- Find others with common interests - You’d be amazed how many others are interested in doing the same and would love to collaborate with you!!!
- Create Community - Start a group, a meetup and get people together and encourage discourse.
- Create your own ‘jargon’ - Express your world, your values by identifying your words. By doing so, you can create your own unique subculture lexicon.
- Institutionalize - Sometimes you have to ‘let go’ in order to grow. Many formal ideologies originated from disruptive and grassroots movements




You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.
