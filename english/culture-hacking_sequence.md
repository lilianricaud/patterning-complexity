# CULTURE HACKING 

## How to hack cultures ?

Se Paquet think there's a lot of things you can hack, not just software and culture is one of them. Here a transcript from a talk he gave in 2010 about culture hacking and that was adapted as a GENERATIVE SEQUENCE.

## What is culture ?

Culture is a shared pattern among a group of people,it's a set of habits that defines the way we see things and the way we relate to one another.

In an organization culture is the social infrastructure, the operating system, defining who talk to whom, who calls the shots.

Culture is all around us, it's something you feel when you turn one tv, when you go to work. It's everywhere. But because it's a set of habits it's invisible (INVISIBLE ARCHITECTURES). Once it gets cultural, it's something you forget about very often. Great culture hacks change habits, the way we see things the way we relate to one another.

Why hack culture ? Seb Paquet thinks "Hackers will hack because they can't not hack" (paraphrasing Mark Pilgrim)

## How do you hack culture ?
How do you hack something that is pretty much invisible ? Hackers use the same kind of tools whether they are culture or software hackers. Culture hackers use hack culture.

## Sequence

### 1. Observe 

Observe the culture and subcultures around you. Let it get into you. It's not something you do by thinking, it's something you do by letting your mind take it in, just listening. 
> Questions to ask:  What do you see? How does it affect you? where can you find opportunities to solve problems and promote change?

### 2. Find the crack
A crack is something that makes you feel unconfortable, you can't name it but you feel there's something wrong in the system and you try to nail it. That's a crack, that's where the light's gonna get in.
> questions to ask: what feels wrong? what are the various situations in which it happens ? what is common/recurrent in these different situations ? Can you find/invent a name for this ?

### 3. Make art
Create something completely new that has never been done. Sometimes you're gonna feel like you're gonna meet resistance but it often turns out that you meet much less resistance that what yo expected. 
> questions to ask: what can you make by playing that feels right and fun ? What can you combine and remix from others to make something new ?

### 4. Find others with common interests (make no compromise) 
Find the other people who have found the crack. You want to avoid the soulless drones or the clueless replicators. People with a sense of humor, unpredictable people, these are the kind of people you want to find. You’d be amazed how many others are interested in doing the same and would love to collaborate with you!
> Questions to ask: Where are the others ? where is you system intersecting with other systems ? Can you explore theses margins ? 


### 5. Catalyze (create community)
Catalysis is really fun part you find other, you get them together and yo do organize something informal, whatever, a party, or something.
> Questions to ask: What can you organize that is simple and fun and that will attract others ? 

### 6. Exploit language (Create your own ‘jargon’) 

Express your world, your values by identifying your words. By doing so, you can create your own unique subculture lexicon.

Together you can create language (visual language, sonic language, music, body language, or plain old words). Put a name on whatever that is you are creating together.
> Questions to ask: What are the recurrent actions, cracks, you use that are specific of you way of working ? How can you call them ? Is there any jargon that is already in use in your context and nowhere else ? Is there any jargon in use in other contexts that is meaningful for you and you could take back to your context?

### 7. Institutionalize 

This is not actually something that the hacker does, it's just that the new pattern replicates itself throughout culture. New institutions or new ways of interacting are built around them.

And then it's time to let go, because if yo feel confortable with you brainchild and you want to stay in it, it's dangerous (GRAVEDIGGER-FOUNDER). 

It's counter intuitive, but it's something you have to let go because you want to move on to observe again and maybe even undermine the very thing that you created a few years back.

> Questions to ask: Do you need to keep looking after your brainchild ? Is your brainchild ripe to grow on it's own even if it's not exactly the way you want it to grow ? 

### 8. Observe again (go back to 1)

It's about constant research and change.
All along, it's very important to keep searching for people who are better than you are, people that you can look up to.

Sometimes you have to look far and wide, you want to look for people who see bullshit and call it accordingly, you want to look for people make you feel unconfortable who challenge you, who have something to teach you.
