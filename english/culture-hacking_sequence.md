Culture hacker

there's a lot of thing you can hack, culture is one of them.

Culture is a shared pattern among a group of people,it's a ste of habits that definesthe way we see things and the way we relate to one another.

In an organization culture is the social infrastructure, the operating system, defines who talk to whom, who calls the shots.

Culture is all around us, it's something you feel when you turn one tv, when you go to work. It's everywhere. But because it's a set of habits it's invisible. Once it gets cultural, it's something you forget about very often. Great culture hacks change habits, the way we see things the way we relate to one another.


Why hack culture ? Seb Paquet thinks "Hackers will hack because they can't not hack" (paraphrasing Mark Pilgrim)

## How do you hack culture ?
How do you hack something that is pretty much invisible ? Hackers use the same kind of tools whether they are culture or software hackers. Culture hackers use hack culture.

## Sequence

### 1. Observe 

Observe the culture and subcultures around you. Let it get into you. It's not something you do by thinking, it's something you do by letting your mind take it in, just listening. 
> Questions to ask:  What do you see? How does it affect you? where can you find opportunities to solve problems and promote change?

### 2. Find the crack
A crack is something that makes you feel unconfortable, you can't name it but you feel there's something wrong in the system and you try to nail it. that's a crack, that's where the ligh's gonna get in.
> questions to ask: what feels wrong? what are the various situations in which it happens ? what is common/recurrent in these different situations ? Can you find/invent a name for this ?

### 3. Make art
Create something completely new that has never been done. Sometimes you're gonna feel like you're gonna meet resistance but it often turns out that you meet much less resistance that what yo expected. 
> questions to ask: what can you make by playing that feels right and fun ? What can you combine and remix from others to make something new ?

### 4. Find others with common interests (make no compromise) 
Find the other people who have found the crack. You want to avoid the soulless drones or the clueless replicators You’d be amazed how many others are interested in doing the same and would love to collaborate with you!!!


### 5. Create Community 
 Start a group, a meetup and get people together and encourage discourse.

### 6. Create your own ‘jargon’ 
Express your world, your values by identifying your words. By doing so, you can create your own unique subculture lexicon.

### 7. Institutionalize 
Sometimes you have to ‘let go’ in order to grow. Many formal ideologies originated from disruptive and grassroots movements
