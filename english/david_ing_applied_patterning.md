## Alexandrian format vs David Ing proposed patterning system

Alexandrian format compared to David Ing proposed patterning system for service systems thinking.


### Alexandrian format (for production systems)

- **(i) Pattern name (plus headline):** A place or spatial feature, phrased as noun or 
adjective-noun, headlined with essence of the problem
- **(ii) Completions of larger patterns:** Introductory context for the pattern, explaining 
how it helps to to complete certain larger patterns.
- **(iii) Range of contexts(physical feature, set of conditions)**: Where this pattern is applicable, the range in which the system of forces can be brought into balance with physical relationships.
- (iv) Problem to be solved(system of forces): Empirical background, evidence for validity, 
range of ways the pattern can be manifested.
- **(v) Solution(configuration of forces):** The field of physical and social relationships which are required to solve the stated problem in the stated context.
- **(vi) Completions to smaller patterns:** Ties from pattern to smaller patterns in the 
language


### David Ing Proposed format for service systems thinking

- **(i) Pattern label:**An *interaction* phrased as a *present participle*
- **(v) Containing systems (slower and larger):** Constraining conditions in which the pattern operates, potentially where multi-issue messes are dissolved
- **(iv) Spatio-temporal frames (where and when):**Occasions at which dwelling in issues 
and affordances are salient and at hand
- **(ii) Voices on issues (who and what):** Archetypal roles of stakeholders, with concerns and interests posed as questions 
- **(iii) Affording value(s) (how and why):** Objects and/or events that enable modes of practised capacities for independent or mutual action
- **(vi) Contained systems (faster and smaller)**: Opportunistic conditions which the 
pattern contains, potentially allowing ad hoc resolving of a specific issue at hand
