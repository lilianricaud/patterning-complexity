# Margins / Edges

Margins/edges of a system are considered one of the most interesting place by permaculture and Theory U.

In permaculture edges are the intersections of several ecosystems and have more potential of interactions and productivity. Permaculture therefore recommends to study and enhance the surface of edges (see edges of a pond for example)

In theory U, edges are places where the system can still evolve and be dynamic (they are'nt saturated yet with STRONG LINKS and WEAK LINKS). Theory U recommend to study the edges in order to understand a system from within.

Alexander doesn't talk explictly about edges, but seems to recognize their importance as seen in the pattern MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES
