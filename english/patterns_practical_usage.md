# PATTERN PRACTICAL USAGE

how to utilize patterns in practice.  

A set of connected patterns provides a framework upon which any design can be anchored. The patterns do not determine the design. 

**By imposing constraints, they eliminate a large number of possibilities while still allowing an infinite number of possible designs. The narrowing of possibilities is, after all, an essential part of a practical design method.**

In practice, it is very cumbersome to work from a complete catalogue of discovered patterns to create a product. 

**A SIMPLIFIED CONNECTIVE LIST can drastically improve the utility of any pattern language**. 

PATTERN CARDS make it easier to manipulate pattern than books.
