# ADAPTIVE DESIGN

Design that adapts to LOCAL CONDITIONS

## Criteria for adaptive design success:
1. The basis for judgment is both practical and psychological.
2. Created forms and spaces are adapted to the human function they aim to
accommodate.
3. The forms and spaces make people feel secure rather than stressed.
4. This complex network of sensations acts subconsciously.
5. Body signals tell the truth, especially when they contradict the userâ€™s
expressed opinion.
