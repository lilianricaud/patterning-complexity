# Living patterns

How to observe a pattern in existing design:
1. Living patterns usually work together as a group: they are rarely isolated.
2. When patterns appear in a weak form, we need to find the strongest example.
3. Patterns organize complexity and are not found in simplistic environments.

Living patterns contribute to successful design solutions. But an architect cannot just pop a living pattern into a building design and expect it to work without any relation to a coherent organizing principle. Inserting living patterns into a rambling, incoherent building will not fix its rambling, incoherent design. While living patterns reinforce each other, they do need to be embedded in an interrelated web of adaptive structure. They are not a quick fix-it for bad design
