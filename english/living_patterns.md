# Living patterns

## Salingaros

Living patterns have immediate consequences for human health and life. They are not simply a matter of individual preference. The relationships embodied in living patterns help create an environment with healing properties. Faster healing after surgery, for instance, depends on exposure to natural environments, and buildings that have the right mathematical qualities mimic this effect. The backstory became evident with research on the concept of biophilia and evidence-based design that arose from it (Browning et al., 2014; Kellert et al., 2008; Mehaffy
& Salingaros, 2015: Chapters 11 & 12; Ryan et al., 2014; Salingaros, 2015). Patterns not directly linked to biology may still be interactive or social, acting together on different scales in a way that mimics nature.

How to observe a pattern in existing design:
1. Living patterns usually work together as a group: they are rarely isolated.
2. When patterns appear in a weak form, we need to find the strongest example.
3. Patterns organize complexity and are not found in simplistic environments.

Living patterns contribute to successful design solutions. But an architect cannot just pop a living pattern into a building design and expect it to work without any relation to a coherent organizing principle. Inserting living patterns into a rambling, incoherent building will not fix its rambling, incoherent design. While living patterns reinforce each other, they do need to be embedded in an interrelated web of adaptive structure. They are not a quick fix-it for bad design

To read the design framework of 253 socio-geometric patterns (Alexander et al.,1977) is to immediately feel the patterns, especially the biophilic ones, to be true in a visceral sense. Living patterns make design a more participatory, vernacular, even democratic process, working to push back against the myth of the “genius” (and
often authoritarian) architect.

Some patterns rely on experiential psychology, driving humans to feel comfortable instead of uncomfortable in different types of settings. Others relate to our visual and spoken communication with passersby, be these sight lines,proximity, and other factors that promote or discourage interaction. Human contact is required for the wellbeing of adults, and especially, at either end of lifespan, for both the emotional formation of children and emotional health of the elderly.

What makes a living pattern is the fact that it’s repeated in a variety of times and places; it forgoes selecting solutions that do not enhance human life. The criterion for judging the effectiveness of any pattern is its usefulness to the overall project, including its setting, and not on narrow considerations of style or ideology.

After selecting a pattern, the designer must figure out the correct combinatorics of other patterns to be used, and make sure that those patterns enhance human health while solving the problem at hand. This checklist relies on the broader organization of complexity in which the patterns are components.

**Repetition does not make a pattern**

Many wrongly believe that a pattern is just a repeating solution, so they tend to look at the most common solutions to solve specific design problems. As a result the solution they end up examining is often a mediocre typology; it’s a pattern that has become embedded in design practice for reasons independent of its capacity for healing. Its implementation has never undergone adequate scientific evaluation, or any evaluation at all. Worse yet, the result of applying it may be disastrous.

## Living architecture relies upon EMERGENCE.

Spaces that feel the most alive, and catalyze the highest intensity of human life, are the result of emergence. This
phenomenon requires that an enormous number of environmental forces align and collaborate to generate “flow”, “coherence”, or “wholeness” (QUALITY WITHOUT A NAME).
