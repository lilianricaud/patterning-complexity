# MERONOMY

A meronomy or partonomy is a type of hierarchy that deals with part–whole relationships, in contrast to a taxonomy whose categorisation is based on discrete sets. Accordingly, the unit of meronomical classification is meron, while the unit of taxonomical classification is taxon. 

In philosophy and mathematical logic, mereology (from the Greek μέρος meros (root: μερε- mere-, "part" [but in Greek: μερολογία]) and the suffix -logy "study, discussion, science") is the study of parts and the wholes they form.
