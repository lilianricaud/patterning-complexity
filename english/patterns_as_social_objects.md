# PATTERNS AS SOCIAL OBJECTS

Schuller et al (2011) are "cautiously optimistic that thinking about patterns as social objects (note 1) will be advantageous to our project. Some of this optimism has been prompted through our experiences with the cards. While specific patterns (as well as the idea of patterns and pattern languages generally) are somewhat abstract, the patterns became objects when they take some discrete form — in which they can be manipulated; i.e. they become "objects."

When objects become "social" they obviously can be called social objects. But when can an object actually be described as social? Obviously any object, a rock for example, can trivially be called a social object when it is employed in a social setting.

I can climb a large rock and address the masses or I can hurl a smaller rock to smite an enemy. I can also impress people with my spectacular rock collection. But rocks are weak social objects at best. Strongly social objects are objects that are routinely or primarily used by people for communication and/or are intended by their creators to be used in that way.

Social objects (physical and digital) based on the Librating Voices patterns can be used to help...

- people generate new ideas;
- generate interest and expertise in a pattern / pattern language orientation;
- generate new ideas for understanding their particular situation and furthering their mission;
- people realize that they are capable of positive social impact;
- further social imagination;
- create new varieties of generative social phenomena. (i.e. things have been created that can themselves be built upon)
- produce things that non-participants can use;
- generate entire online applications or organizations;
- engender group formation and collaboration; (PATTERNS FOR GROUP ALIGNEMENT)
- "train the trainers";
- help, in the Alexandrine sense, engender the existence of the pattern itself; i.e. the Civic Intelligence pattern can begat more civic intelligence while Everyday Heroism helps legitimatize more everyday heroism. But,
additionally, Civic Intelligence can engender everyday heroism and vice versa.

## Remaining questions

Social Objects
• How do we improve our patterns as "social objects?" What can be done to make the patterns "good" social objects?
Some proposed features include accessibility, transferability, annotatability, manipulability, promiscuity (the ability to interact with many others), clarity, interaction promoting, and learning promoting. (And are these the same attributes that a good word or concept would have?)
• Can the virtual digital world support the same rich, social interplay that using the cards in synchronous in-person environments does?
• What additional value can people obtain from patterns as social objects as opposed to, say, reading them in the book?
• Does the brain think differently about a pattern when they hold the card in their hand? We suspect that the answer is yes. The pattern, perhaps, loses its abstract nature — and hence its inaccessibility —and becomes actual — at least in their minds.
• How much mileage can we get from designating our cards as creative commons? In other words, is there an audience
for this type of artifact and how can we get the word out to them?
• What types of application programming interfaces (APIs) would be useful for effective sharing of the pattern cards as social objects?
• How can collaborative annotation help people construct — and employ — pattern languages?
