## Social Objects
Schuller et al (2011) are "cautiously optimistic that thinking about patterns as social objects (note 1) will be advantageous to our project. Some of this optimism has been prompted through our experiences with the cards. While specific patterns (as well as the idea of patterns and pattern languages generally) are somewhat abstract, the patterns became objects when they take some discrete form â€” in which they can be manipulated; i.e. they become "objects."

When objects become "social" they obviously can be called social objects. But when can an object actually be described as social? Obviously any object, a rock for example, can trivially be called a social object when it is employed in a social setting.

I can climb a large rock and address the masses or I can hurl a smaller rock to smite an enemy. I can also impress people with my spectacular rock collection. But rocks are weak social objects at best. Strongly social objects are objects that are routinely or primarily used by people for communication and/or are intended by their creators to be used in that way.
