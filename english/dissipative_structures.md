# Dissipative structures

In classic thermodynamics, disspatio of heat is always associated with a loss of energy.

Prigogine's csoncept of dissipative structure introduce a radical change of viewpoint by showin that in open systems, dissipation can be a source of order. when the flow of matter and energy going through systems increase, the become unstable and transform into new EMERGENT structures with greater complexity.

There are BIFURCATION POINTS where the system can evolve to different states, each characterized by a specific ATTRACTOR where new structures and new form of order emerge.

The system's transformation is linked to fluctuations amplified by FEEDBACK LOOPS.
