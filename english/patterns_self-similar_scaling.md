# SELF-SIMILAR SCALING

A few patterns might work equally well on different levels, though most patterns' context establishes their place in a particular scale of the pattern language. Some patterns can be moved up or down vertically within a language. 

**Such a property leads to economy in a pattern language through self-similar scaling, which means that one scale looks the same as another scale when magnified.** A pattern language that develops coherence (COHERENT STRUCTURE) over time may also develop a degree of self-similar scaling as a result of the connections across levels (PATTERNS HIERARCHICAL CONNECTION). 

As the ensemble of patterns evolves a cooperative structure, driven by the alignment of patterns (or anti-patterns) on different levels, it creates unexpected similarities.

Thus, each level of a coherent structure expresses a property that is characteristic of the whole.
