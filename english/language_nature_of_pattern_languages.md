# LANGUAGE NATURE OF PATTERN LANGUAGES

A pattern language is more than just a patterns catalogue.

A pattern is an encapsulation of forces; a general solution to a problem. Individual patterns are easier to describe than their language, yet a catalogue is only a dictionary.

Sticking patterns together without proper ordering will not provide an overall coherence (COHERENT STRUCTURE). Each component might work individually, but the whole does not work, precisely because it is not a WHOLE.

The rules by which the patterns (nodes) connect are just as important as the patterns themselves. Words without connection rules cannot make up a language. 

The 'language' combines the nodes into an organizational framework. A loose collection of patterns is not a system, because it lacks connections (PATTERN CONNECTIVITY) has no COHERENT STRUCTURE and  and therefore no WHOLENESS.
