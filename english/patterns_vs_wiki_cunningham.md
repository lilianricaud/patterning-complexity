# Patterns vs wiki

in simplest terms, a pattern represents a structure in the world that has value in a particular context.

Both patterns and wikis are useful only in the context of a publication â€“ that is, a web page, a book or other tangible form of dissemination.

pattern language = hyperlinked network that can be linked in useful ways according to the user's needs.


In all three cases, the publication is not of a single discrete and static body of information, but of a hyperlinked
network that can be linked in useful ways according to the user's needs.

entities of interest to us can be represented within a contextual modeling system taking the form of an
open-ended network, and then it can be published and subsequently edited and refined.


The general logic of pattern languages is closely related to the hierarchically compressed structure of object-oriented programming. A series of re-useable information packets can be manipulated as units, within a grammar-like set of rules for combining and exchanging their inputs and outputs. However, as we will discuss, pattern languages have particularly useful attributes that are more similar to those of natural language.

a pattern is a cluster of forces at one scale, which can be combined with other clusters, using grammar-like relationships.

like patterns, wikis are bodies that evolve through repeated application, evaluation and refinement.

Wikis were developed in 1995 as a tool to support the development of pattern languages in software (Cunningham, 2009). More specifically, it was developed as a tool to allow collaboration between many people as they evolve better collective solutions to shared problems.
