# Patterns vs wiki

in simplest terms, a pattern represents a structure in the world that has value in a particular context.

Both patterns and wikis are useful only in the context of a publication – that is, a web page, a book or other tangible form of dissemination.

pattern language = hyperlinked network that can be linked in useful ways according to the user's needs.


In all three cases, the publication is not of a single discrete and static body of information, but of a hyperlinked
network that can be linked in useful ways according to the user's needs.

entities of interest to us can be represented within a contextual modeling system taking the form of an
open-ended network, and then it can be published and subsequently edited and refined.


The general logic of pattern languages is closely related to the hierarchically compressed structure of object-oriented programming. A series of re-useable information packets can be manipulated as units, within a grammar-like set of rules for combining and exchanging their inputs and outputs. However, as we will discuss, pattern languages have particularly useful attributes that are more similar to those of natural language.

a pattern is a cluster of forces at one scale, which can be combined with other clusters, using grammar-like relationships.

like patterns, wikis are bodies that evolve through repeated application, evaluation and refinement.

Wikis were developed in 1995 as a tool to support the development of pattern languages in software (Cunningham, 2009). More specifically, it was developed as a tool to allow collaboration between many people as they evolve better collective solutions to shared problems.

## Pattern languages and wiki both share the following unique set of characteristics:
A. *Both are open-ended sets of information, consisting of unitary subsets (pages or patterns) connected by hyperlinks.* Each set of information is able to expand, while remaining within a linked network.
B. **Both are topical essays with a characteristic structure: overview (with links), definition, discussion, evidence, conclusion, further links.** This limited structure creates the capacity for extensibility and interoperability – the capacity of new pages to function smoothly with older ones, with the capacity for open-ended growth.
C. **Both are structured to be easily creatable, shareable and editable by many people.** This capacity facilitates the creation of user communities, who are crucial to the development of a large and useful body of shareable pages or patterns.
D. **Both are (in principle) evolutionary, falsifiable and refinable.** As structured essays, both make assertions about characteristics of the world they describe – assertions that can be falsified. Once falsified, they can be modified to correct discrepancies, and to refine accuracy. This evolutionary capacity translates into greater accuracy and usefulness over time.
E. **Both aim to create useful ontological models of a portion of the world, as a more formalized subset of language.**
These are models of design specifically for pattern languages, and models of knowledge more generally for wikis.

## NEW TECHNOLOGIES EXPLOITING THE NATURAL CAPACITIES OF LANGUAGE

1. Humans have the capacity to construct shared reality through a series of acts.
2. When those acts are vocalizations we call them speech acts in natural language.
3. Those acts and their consequence are heritable and thus subject to evolution.
4. Pattern language, as developed by Christopher Alexander, mapped a useful subset of the heritable knowledge of building.
5. Wiki, as developed by Ward Cunningham, maps a useful subset of heritable knowledge within the context of user websites, and their missions or “site charters”.
