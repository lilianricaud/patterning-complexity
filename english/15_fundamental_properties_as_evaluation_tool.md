# 15 fundamental properties as an evaluation tool

Salingaros: "I recently gave some guest lectures in a colleague’s “Great Buildings” survey course. Both of us were convinced that introducing geometrical criteria for judgment would lend a unifying theme to all the disparate buildings covering the history of humankind. We needed some compact set of relations that link to living patterns.

I explained Alexander’s “Fifteen Fundamental Properties” (Alexander, 2001; Leitner, 2015; Salingaros, 2015a) to the class, and how to identify these properties in buildings. Teams of students then presented one building at a time, identifying as many of the fifteen geometrical properties as possible.

This method worked marvelously for the historical buildings, as students discovered all of the expected geometrical
qualities built into the designs. Finding that dissimilar “great buildings” share common geometrical features—that,

moreover, generate the buildings’ appeal— helps to unify our understanding of design and the history of architecture.

Those criteria contribute subconsciously to our perception of what makes a building “great” but are not normally
noticed. It was especially interesting to see early modernist buildings embodying some of the desirable geometrical
properties. (After all, their architects were trained in the classical idiom.)

A surprise came with modernist icons and more recent buildings. I expected the students to discover that many
famous modernist and contemporary buildings do not satisfy Alexander’s “Fifteen Fundamental Properties.”
Architectural culture judges those using totally distinct (and sometimes opposite) criteria. I watched and listened with amazement while students presented iconic buildings lacking any of the fifteen fundamental properties, yet **the teams showed diagrams illustrating geometrical features that were simply not there!**

What caused this bizarre misunderstanding? 

Actually, a binding judgment was made before the class had even
begun. All the buildings included in the picture textbook used for this course had automatically acquired the status
of “great.” At the same time, the geometrical checklist made an intuitive sense, reinforced by the fact that well-loved buildings relied on these properties. These positive geometrical characteristics were correctly identified as
universal; hence the contemporary “great” buildings, it was assumed, must satisfy them.
