# PATTERNS HIERARCHICAL CONNECTION

Hierarchical connections across scales exist in pattern languages.

Every COMPLEX SYSTEM has a hierarchical structure (SYSTEMS HIERACHICAL STRUCTURE); i.e., different processes are occurring on different scales or levels. Connections exist both on the same levels, and across level (Mesarovic, Macko et al., 1970). 

The same is true for a pattern language. The 'language' generates a connective network by which the ordering of nodes on one level creates nodes at a higher level (LANGUAGE NATURE OF PATTERN LANGUAGE). This process goes on all the way up, and all the way down in levels. 

The cohesive framework provided by the language enables the upward transition to all the higher levels. We can better understand a language if it has organization at different levels, because each level is shielded from the complexity in all the other levels. 

A pattern language does not have a strictly modular rule structure - as would be the case if the language were defined by only a few basic units - but adds new rules as the scales grow. 

Higher levels in a system are dependent on all lower levels, but not vice-versa (Passioura, 1979). Even though disconnected lower-level patterns can work without necessarily forming a higher-level pattern, such a system is not cohesive, because it exists on only one level. 

Each level in a complex hierarchical system is supported by the properties of the next-lower level. The combination of patterns acting on a smaller level of scale acquires new and unexpected properties not present in the constituent patterns, and these are expressed in a higher-level pattern. 

Patterns on higher levels are therefore necessary because they incorporate new information. Many failures in describing a complex system are due to not allowing for enough levels. 

A gap between levels disconnects the pattern language, since the patterns on different levels are then too far apart to be related. We tend to fall into this trap because of non-hierarchical thinking. 

Some urban patterns work on the scale of 100m and contain architectural patterns that work on the scale of 1 m, but what about the patterns on all the intermediate scales? An even more serious problem is the widespread association of importance with size in our culture. Working within that mindset, it is very easy to concentrate only on the large-scale patterns (or anti-patterns), and ignore those on lower levels. That makes it impossible to validate patterns through their vertical connections.  

**One of the principal methods of validating a pattern language is that every pattern be connected vertically to patterns on both higher and lower levels.**   Damage to a pattern language can be understood visually, by crossing out any single pattern.

This will remove the coordination of all the linked patterns below it; moreover, if a vertical relation is one of inclusion, then obviously those patterns below are also eliminated. In addition, all linked patterns above the crossed pattern are automatically eliminated. Therefore, removing one pattern without understanding its connections damages a significant portion of the pattern language because it also removes at least one vertical chain of patterns. It is necessary to address a misunderstanding that identifies any multi-level structure with an inverted tree-like hierarchical ordering. In a tree, everything is ordered from a single node above, and nodes on the same level do not link directly. Although some authors use this terminology, that is not what is meant here. Figure 17 shows that the hierarchy we propose for pattern languages is not an inverted tree, because it has multiple tops and horizontal connections; i.e., several times more connections than a tree has. A hierarchical inverted tree structure is too restrictive, since all communication has to pass through higher-level nodes. Inverted tree-like hierarchies are associated with systems that exert top-down control (Alexander, 1965).
