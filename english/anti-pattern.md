# DEAD PATTERNS 

Dead patterns leak out, infect other patterns (Alexander 1979)

Eventually when a system contains such dead or anti-pattern, it will collapses. 

## Examples

### ARCH vs STRONG BEAM

The way to make a door while retaining a huge weight above. using ARCH or STRONG BEAM will influence the evolution of the system. When ARCH is present the system will be quite stable because the weight of the WALL is well spread. When STRONG BEAM is present, the property of the opening relies on the strenght of the material. However the weigh will alway produce some micro-breaks where the force of the weight is highest. This micro-breaks are sensitive to water and freezing. Eventually if some water comes and freeze it will amplify the breaks, eventually leading to collapses. STRONG BEAM works physically, but from a systemic point of view it's a FORCED FUNCTION that leads to STRESS of the system.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

Anti-patterns as non-solutions; to be coupled with patterns in pairs (towards problem-solving)
