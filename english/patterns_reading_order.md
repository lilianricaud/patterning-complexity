# PATTERNS READING ORDER

see also SEQUENCE OF PATTERNS USAGE.

Alexander presents the Pattern Language as a practical tool, and orders the patterns in roughly decreasing size. That is the correct ordering when one is using them for design, since decisions on the largest scale have to be made first. Nevertheless, that presupposes that the patterns are understood to be true in a fundamental sense. 

The problem is that mainstream architecture never entirely accepted Alexandrine patterns; it was the more sensitive and spiritual fringe movements that did. **To validate the above patterns, they have to be read in the opposite order: small to large.** 

The human mind can combine the smaller patterns into groups; the larger patterns utilize these groupings and also generate new properties that are not present in the component patterns. The mind is capable of validating the patterns subconsciously when we read the patterns in an evolving (small-to-large) order. 

Even now, more than 20 years after its publication, the fundamental significance of the Pattern Language is hardly appreciated. Many people still think of it as a catalogue of personal preferences, which is a total misconception (Dovey, 1990). Even those who realize that each pattern is established either though empirical observation, or by scientific reasoning, often fail to see its inevitability. 

I recommend, though, that you **photocopy the relevant patterns from A Pattern Language (Alexander, Ishikawa et al., 1977), and staple them together in the reversed order.**

**Reading them without the distractions of all other patterns helps to connect them in the reader's mind, and the natural progression small to large reveals the connections between successively larger scales** (PATTERNS HIERARCHICAL CONNECTION).
