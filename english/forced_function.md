# Forced function

In permaculture, when a part of system is used in way that goes against its natural function, we talk about forced function.

Seeking to minimize energy waste, permaculture recognize that when an element of a system is allowed to function naturally it use less energy than when if it forced to go against is natural behavior.

For example in traditionnal agriculture, "weeds" are seen as bad and must be eliminated which is energitically costly and endless. In permaculture, it is seen as an indicator about the nature of soils and use to contribute to regenerate soils.

Permaculture goes further, trying to design system so natural functions of elements is beneficial to system instead of destructive.


For example chicken scratch the soil and east seedlings, which can be damaging for a garden when chicken are left free. On the other end, chicken left in cage accumulate lots of manure and nothing grow and chicken don't have fresh food.

So permaculture builds CHICKEN TRACTORS, a mobile cage that is use to keep chicken within specific parts of a garden, just for the time to eat weeds, seedling, scratch, add manure, eat insects and then the cage is move like tractor that prepare the soil without turning it and without much energy.
