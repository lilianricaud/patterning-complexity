# Edge of chaos

The term Edge of chaos is used to denote a transition space between order and disorder that is hypothesized to exist within a wide variety of systems. This transition zone between the two regimes is known as the edge of chaos, a region of bounded instability that engenders a constant dynamic interplay between order and disorder.[2]

Even though the idea of the edge of chaos is abstract and intuitive, it has many applications in such fields as ecology,[3] business management,[4] psychology,[5] political science, and other domains of the social science. Physicists have shown that adaptation to the edge of chaos occurs in almost all systems with feedback.
