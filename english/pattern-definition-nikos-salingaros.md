# Salingaros pattern explanation

Patterns describe essential relationships among the elements of systems, and provide a unique and useful tool for handling and organizing complexity.


The pattern format recommends a set of design constraints; relationships that narrow the specific expression of any given design solution. This constraining specificity enables the transmission of such healing knowledge from one culture, historical time and place to another (Salingaros, 2005: Chapter 8).

Identifying any type of pattern follows the same criteria in architecture as in hardware or software.

1. A repeating solution to the same or similar set of problems, discovered by independent researchers and users at different times.
2. More or less universal solution across distinct topical applications, rather than being heavily dependent upon local and specific conditions.
3. That makes a pattern a simple general statement that addresses only one of many aspects of a complex system. Part of the pattern methodology is to isolate factors of complex situations so as to solve each one in an independent manner if possible.
4. A pattern may be discovered or "mined" by "excavating" successful practices developed by trial‐and‐error already in use, but which are not consciously treated as a pattern by those who use it. A successful pattern is already in use somewhere, perhaps not everywhere, but it does not represent a utopian or untried situation. Nor does it represent someone's opinion of what "should" occur.
5. A pattern must have a higher level of abstraction that makes it useful on a more general level, otherwise we are overwhelmed with solutions that are too specific, and thus useless for any other situation. A pattern will have an essential area of vagueness that guarantees its universality.


Computer researchers have adopted the pattern method both to understand and to manipulate complexity.
Advances in our knowledge of how patterns reflect the ordered complexity of nature has led to breakthroughs in computer technology that continue to fuel economic growth and development not just in industry but in every realm of our society (Leitner, 2015; Mehaffy & Salingaros, 2015).

## Patterns as design constraints

Alexander’s The Nature of Order (Alexander, 2001-2005) correctly understands
such patterns as constraints in a sophisticated system of computational design. You
choose from among an infinite number of generated options that satisfy an
interrelated group of patterns. All of these solutions are adaptive. The more
constraints you impose, the narrower the set of good solutions. The design process
may include adaptive constraints such as climate, site, orientation, interaction with
the environment and surrounding structures, etc.

## Patterns ad adaptive design tools

Patterns are an ADAPTIVE DESIGN tool — already available, developed previously by someone else. Their documentation saves architects an enormous amount of work. They need not rethink everything to implement a new project. The flexibility of living patterns means that what is re-used is only the most relevant structural relationship, conveyed as an evidence-based proposition. A living pattern does not merely copy an image from the past but implements the latest upgrade. In this sense, living patterns are tools of evolutionary, adaptive design (Leitner, 2015; Mehaffy & Salingaros, 2015: Chapter 18).
