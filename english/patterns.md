# PATTERNS

Pattern is a complex concept with several meaning and used slight differently in different disciplines.

## Pattern of organization (COMPLEX SYSTEMS): 

In SYSTEMS THINKING, patterns are configuration of relationships characteristic of a particular system.

Can be seen as invariant in flux (PATTERNS AS INVARIANTS IN FLUX).

## ALEXANDRINE PATTERNS / LIVING PATTERNS / GENERATIVE PATTERNS 

Architect Christopher Alexander proposed a new meaning for patterns. In Alexander's is only interested in pattern of organization that enhance LIFE/QUALITY WITHOUT A NAME within a particular system. 

A living pattern solves a complex problem, increase SELF-ORGANIZATION and system stability.

At their core, patterns describe a RELATIONSHIP/CONFIGURATION between elements (themselves being patterns of relationships).

Alexander also proposed a formal description for documenting patterns that help leverage them as design tools (PATTERN DESCRIPTION BY DAVID ING).

Patterns themselves are not to be used in isolation but in coherent framework called PATTERN LANGUAGE. Patterns work via cooperation to build up complex wholes that coexist and compete in some dynamic balance.

According to Alexander, LIVING PATTERNS cannot be conceived but have to be mined, ie GENERATED via a GENERATIVE SEQUENCE.

## DESIGN PATTERNS

Computer researchers have adopted the pattern method both to understand and to manipulate complexity.

Inspired by Christopher Alexander's work, they use the The 3-PARTS RULE format of patterns to describe good practice in their field.

## SALINGAROS PATTERN DEFINITION


## ANTIPATTERNS

Not simply opposite of living patterns, but deadening patterns. 

Some authors use antipatterns base approach to mine for living patterns (ANTIPATTERNS APPROACH), but Salingaros warns that The solution space, which is distinct from the parameter space, is rarely one-dimensional, which means that knowing what doesn't work cannot give what works simply by doing the opposite. 

There may be an infinity of different opposites. One needs to exhaust the solution space by identifying many neighbouring anti-patterns before zeroing in on the pattern itself. 

## PATTERNS FOR GROUP ALIGNEMENT

PATTERNS AS SOCIAL OBJECTS can help for GROUP ALIGNEMENT (PATTERNS FOR GROUP ALIGNEMENT).
