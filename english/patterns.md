# PATTERNS

Pattern is a complex concept with several meaning and used slight differently in different disciplines.

## Pattern of organization (COMPLEX SYSTEMS): 

In SYSTEMS THINKING, patterns are configuration of relationships characteristic of a particular system.

Can be seen as invariant in flux (PATTERNS AS INVARIANTS IN FLUX).

## ALEXANDRINE PATTERNS / LIVING PATTERNS / GENERATIVE PATTERNS 

Architect Christopher Alexander proposed a new meaning for patterns. In Alexander's is only interested in pattern of organization that enhance LIFE/QUALITY WITHOUT A NAME within a particular system. 

Increase SELF-ORGANIZATION and system stability.

At their core, patterns describe a RELATIONSHIP/CONFIGURATION between elements (themselves being patterns of relationships).

Alexander also proposed a formal description for documenting patterns that help leverage them as design tools.

Patterns themselves are not to be used in isolation but in coherent framework called PATTERN LANGUAGE.

According to Alexander, LIVING PATTERNS cannot be conceived but have to be mined, ie GENERATED via a GENERATIVE SEQUENCE.

## DESIGN PATTERNS

Inspired by Christopher Alexander's work, computer scientists and developpers used the The 3-PARTS RULE format of patterns to describe good practice in their field
