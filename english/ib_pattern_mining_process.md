# Iba on pattern mining

## Pattern mining

First, it helps us to discover the common  patterns  drawn  from  individual  experiences.  At  the  end  of  the  clustering  process,  we  are  left  with multiple groups of sticky notes with similar contents. Simply stated, these are the patterns lurking beneath the multiple  experiences  and  cases

The second important role of clustering is to adjust the level of abstraction and granularity of the possible 
patterns.  Fragments  of  information  extracted  from  the  mining  dialog  usually  differ  in  terms  of  the  level  of abstraction  and  the  scale  of  contents. 

The  clustering  process  involves  deep  reflection  about  the  meaning  of  every  single  sticky  note.  It 
demands that we go beyond the superficial meaning of the words.

The opportunity for discussion provides the opportunity  to  obtain  a  common  understanding  of  the  patterns,  which  becomes  the  foundation  of  the  next activity, Pattern Writing.

### Starting from Chaos

This begins with writing down knowledge of practice (rules of thumb and tips) collected from the mining dialog sticky notes and placing them on the craft paper on the table at random 

### Talking while Moving
### Hidden Meanings
### One-to-One Comparison
### Doubting Clusters
### Discovering the Islands
