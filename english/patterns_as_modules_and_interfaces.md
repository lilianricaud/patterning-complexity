# PATTERNS AS MODULES AND INTERFACES


Modular structure of Alexander's Pattern Language

Alexandrine patterns express strong local forces that manifest themselves as either a particular geometry, or as a repeating human action (Salingaros, 2000). By encapsulating the essence of why similar structures arise repeatedly around the world and throughout history, "patterns" represent the most intelligent decomposition of architectural and urban systems that has ever been attempted. Alexander's Pattern Language was misunderstood as being a catalogue of modules, whereas in fact many of the patterns identify interfaces that govern how modules connect to each other (Alexander, Ishikawa et al., 1977). Alexander and his colleagues realized that connective interfaces -- such as boundaries, physical connections, transition regions, and geometrical edges that harbor fundamental human activities -- are essential to creating urban coherence. As in the decomposition of any complex system, architectural and urban interfaces have to be defined with just as much care as the modules themselves.

Alexander looked for patterns of human activity and interaction, and analyzed to what extent the built geometry either encouraged or discouraged them. He thus defined modules of human and social "life" in a way that correlates them with specific geometrical settings. Invariably, these functional modules do not correspond to any self-contained geometrical module, but rather to edges and interfaces in the urban geometry. Here is the alternative decomposition of a living system that follows human activity modules, and which we expect from systems theory. What life a city has occurs as a result of emergence along the interfaces of a decomposition carried out along geometric lines. Emergent properties will not appear directly from the geometrical modules, because those are usually fixed. The exception to this is free, unrestrained building, such as occurs in the favelas of the third world.

In writing the Pattern Language, Alexander wanted above all a method for generating coherence in the built environment. As clearly articulated by Alexander himself, buildings and urban regions designed according to the Pattern Language, although far more accommodating of human movement and interaction than equivalent structures that violate it, have not always added up to a coherent whole (Alexander, 2000). This practical observation is consistent with our interpretation of patterns as modules and interfaces: one can put them together correctly but still not recover (or generate) the emergent properties of a coherent system, such as the essential qualities of great historical buildings or urban regions that have developed over time.

Even though a driving criterion for distilling each individual pattern originally was "to what extent does this pattern contribute to generate a unified whole?" achieving system wholeness depends upon the organization of connections outside the Pattern Language.
