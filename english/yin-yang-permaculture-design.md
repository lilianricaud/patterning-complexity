yin-yang permaculture design

Use the ying-yang aspect of nature to harvest more energy/yield

there is no up without down
no hot without without cold
light without dark
left/right

As a a designer we should look at existing ying/yang patterns within the system and see how we can 

Harness existing pattern (ex:
-existing slope to move water, nutrients, material, …)
- sunny/shady places to grow sun loving/shade loving plants, place elements that require warming cooling (walls, tanks, …)
- warm side, cool side of valley, house

Accentuate yin/yang differences for our benefit
- place tank higher on the slope by using structure
- increase shade by planting more plants, placing roof structure

Reduce yin/yang differences for our benefit
Break down slope into terraces, swales to slow down water, erosion


Combine yin/yang differences from different elements to accentuate or reduce differences:

More shade + more wind for more cooling

As a designer we can increase, channel or deflect.
