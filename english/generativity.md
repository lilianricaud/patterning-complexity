# GENERATIVITY

refers to the capacity to reproduce the essence of a functioning structure without having to specify all of its characteristics.

Exemple: the way a genetic process generates the blue eyes, say, of a child, which recapitulates the blue eyes of the parent without having to specify them in minute detail (their intricate retinal pattern, round shape, etc). Instead, the genetic process is able to generate, and regenerate, an intricately complex structure from a relatively simple set of language-like instructions.
