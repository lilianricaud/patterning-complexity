## Find a complex/living environment

The complexity of the best, most humanly adapted living configurations, which solve more than one design problem simultaneously, is high. A setting that has positive effects on the user’s wellbeing probably has several patterns working together to satisfy a combination of system dynamics (some of which are not obvious). So a researcher trying to document patterns must first disentangle them from one another.

## Observe, starting by what is known

As in most scientific research, you first detect known patterns.
What is left contains the new patterns. This discovery process is necessarily sequential (STEP-BY-STEP ADAPTATION), and cannot be achieved all at once.




## Identify distinct solutions

Then, you may discover a set of similar but distinct solutions to a specific design problem whose common features identify them as possible living patterns. Suppose each related application shows undeniable healing effects on the user. But which particular constraint is the archetypal pattern? 

A choice among several variations of a common theme must be made. 

## Identify optimal healing variations

The optimal living pattern is the most “wonderful” — the one that works best, that gives the most healing feedback, and makes a user wish to experience its implementation as much as possible. Obviously, this living pattern will be difficult to locate.

An architect must learn to identify patterns, and then design a solution that takes advantage of the mutual adaptivity arising from the ordered complexity common to living patterns.

How to observe a pattern in existing design:
1. Living patterns usually work together as a group: they are rarely isolated.
2. When patterns appear in a weak form, we need to find the strongest example.
3. Patterns organize complexity and are not found in simplistic environments.

An archetypal living pattern must deliver the strongest and most positive effect on human health and comfort for that particular circumstance. That way, it can reproduce the same healing effect when built into something new. Competing forces of expediency, fashion, short-term economy, or misguided architectural codes and zoning laws are likely to dilute a pattern in many of its applications. 

**Finding a living pattern requires looking for the best possible built example, like a collector searching for the very finest seashell or antique coin specimen.** This process of discovery presupposes experience, and a highly tuned sensitivity to healing environments.
