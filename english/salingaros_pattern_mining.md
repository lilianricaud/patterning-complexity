## Find a complex/living environment

The complexity of the best, most humanly adapted living configurations, which solve more than one design problem simultaneously, is high. A setting that has positive effects on the user’s wellbeing probably has several patterns working together to satisfy a combination of system dynamics (some of which are not obvious). So a researcher trying to document patterns must first disentangle them from one another.

Because a living pattern solves a group of linked problems, its complexity is often underestimated. Most living patterns have evolved in context, embedded in highly complex adaptive systems from which they cannot be easily isolated. **They work because they satisfy many different system dynamics (some of which may not even be known)**. Ignoring adaptation and complexity can lead to superficial solutions that prove inadequate or wrong. Typologies that fail to solve a problem adaptively, yet are tried again and again despite their poor utility, fool us because they could solve one part of a problem. They also generate some serious problems in other parts of the system.

## Observe, starting by what is known

As in most scientific research, you first detect known patterns.
What is left contains the new patterns. This discovery process is necessarily sequential (STEP-BY-STEP ADAPTATION), and cannot be achieved all at once.




## Identify distinct solutions

Then, you may discover a set of similar but distinct solutions to a specific design problem whose common features identify them as possible living patterns. Suppose each related application shows undeniable healing effects on the user. But which particular constraint is the archetypal pattern? 

A choice among several variations of a common theme must be made. 

## Identify optimal healing variations

The optimal living pattern is the most “wonderful” — the one that works best, that gives the most healing feedback, and makes a user wish to experience its implementation as much as possible. Obviously, this living pattern will be difficult to locate.

An architect must learn to identify patterns, and then design a solution that takes advantage of the mutual adaptivity arising from the ordered complexity common to living patterns.

How to observe a pattern in existing design:
1. Living patterns usually work together as a group: they are rarely isolated.
2. When patterns appear in a weak form, we need to find the strongest example.
3. Patterns organize complexity and are not found in simplistic environments.

An archetypal living pattern must deliver the strongest and most positive effect on human health and comfort for that particular circumstance. That way, it can reproduce the same healing effect when built into something new. Competing forces of expediency, fashion, short-term economy, or misguided architectural codes and zoning laws are likely to dilute a pattern in many of its applications. 

**Finding a living pattern requires looking for the best possible built example, like a collector searching for the very finest seashell or antique coin specimen.** This process of discovery presupposes experience, and a highly tuned sensitivity to healing environments.


## Evaluating new patterns
Simple tests can validate a living pattern and distinguish it from a non-adaptive typology prior to implementation. For instance, check to see if a pattern links to tested patterns outside its immediate domain. Focus on emotional feedback from real-life instances where it has been applied. These measures can give clues to whether we are dealing with a pattern or an arbitrary typology, and predict if it is going to be useful or harmful (Salingaros, 2005).

In order to discover optimal solutions quickly, design students may look at simple situations rather than explore
all possible variants and precedents.

## Using patterns

We need to select precisely those patterns required for any adaptive solution. Do we have all the relevant patterns ready, worked out and documented? It might be that, while we have access to some living patterns, no pattern has yet been discovered for each of the new problems we face in the 21 st century. The task of the designer, architect, and planner is to invent or extract such living patterns before proceeding further.

How many living patterns do we include in trying to solve a design problem? Work with too many, and we confuse user and over-burden the designer (Salingaros, 2005). So use only a small set of the most relevant patterns at any one time.

The most robust links among individual patterns are not always obvious, nor do techniques for combining them necessarily follow a simple logic. Here is where Christopher Alexander’s work on organizational coherence provides the tools to solve the problem (Alexander, 2001-2005). The strategy is to take steps to combine the chosen patterns in increasingly coherent geometrical and functional configurations. And remember, it’s impossible to achieve such coherence in one step. (-> use STEP BY STEP ADAPTATION).
