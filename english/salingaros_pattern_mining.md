As in most scientific research, you first detect known patterns.
What is left contains the new patterns. This discovery process is necessarily sequential (STEP-BY-STEP ADAPTATION), and cannot be achieved all at once.

How to observe a pattern in existing design:
1. Living patterns usually work together as a group: they are rarely isolated.
2. When patterns appear in a weak form, we need to find the strongest example.
3. Patterns organize complexity and are not found in simplistic environments.
