## Find a complex/living context

The complexity of the best, most humanly adapted living configurations, which solve more than one design problem simultaneously, is high. A setting that has positive effects on the userâ€™s wellbeing probably has several patterns working together to satisfy a combination of system dynamics (some of which are not obvious). So a researcher trying to document patterns must first disentangle them from one another.

## Observe, start by what is known

As in most scientific research, you first detect known patterns.
What is left contains the new patterns. This discovery process is necessarily sequential (STEP-BY-STEP ADAPTATION), and cannot be achieved all at once.

How to observe a pattern in existing design:
1. Living patterns usually work together as a group: they are rarely isolated.
2. When patterns appear in a weak form, we need to find the strongest example.
3. Patterns organize complexity and are not found in simplistic environments.
