# 5 types of generative process


Roy identifies five different types of generative processes: construction, development, autopoiesis, emergence, and evolution. 
 
- With construction, components are the result of applied work aimed at producing a given direct effect. 
- With development, the system is transformed through the realization of its potentials. Work is applied towards generating capacity / capability. 
- With autopoiesis, the system (re)generates itself in interaction with its environment, maintaining its properties and continuously regenerating its own organization. 
- With emergence, unexpected properties (synergies) result from the interaction between parts which do not prefigure these properties when taken individually. 
- With evolution, the system transforms itself through adaptations and  evolutions at different levels and scales of diversified processes which interact with one another.

Complex systems, and in particular the challenges that they entail involve many processes of the autopoietic, emergent and evolutionary type. Systemic design in this context is not so much about finding ‘solutions’ to problems, but rather understanding and designing for autopoiesis, emergence and evolution and their combination 
in very indirect ways, targeting leverage points, in addition to more direct construction and developmental processes, and then evaluating resulting forms and actually generated behaviors.
