# 5 types of generative process


Roy identifies five different types of generative processes 128 : construction, development, autopoiesis, emergence, and evolution 129 . 
 
With construction, components are the result of applied work aimed at producing a given direct effect. With development, the system is transformed through the realization of its potentials. Work is applied towards generating capacity / capability. With autopoiesis, the system (re)generates itself in interaction with its environment, maintaining its properties and continuously regenerating its own organization. With emergence, unexpected properties (synergies) result from the interaction between parts which do not prefigure these properties when taken individually. With evolution, the system transforms itself through adaptations and 
evolutions at different levels and scales of diversified processes which interact with one another
