# Strange attractor

To reveal ordered patterns, the variable of a complex system are displayed in an abstractt mathematical space called "phased space".

Every variable is associated with coordinate, points represent the entire system over time -> trajectory = attractor

There are a limited number of different attractors and their shapes can be classified topologically.

The general dynamic properties of a system can be deduced from the shape of its attractor.

- Point attractors -> system reaching stable equilibrium
- Perdiodic attractors -> periodic oscillations
- Strange attractors -> chaotic systems

A system may have 50 variables, but its motion may be restricted to a strange attractor of 3 dimensions.
