# STEP BY STEP ADAPTATION

Alexander and agile method emphasize the importance of step by step adaptation to make sure we match the reality of what is at a certain moment and avoid costly design mistake.

STRUCTURE-PRESERVING TRANSFORMATION

Permaculture is starting to become _explicitely_ aware of the importance of step by step adaptation.

As Alexander says, "to make the adaptation successful, the process must be relaxed about the unpredictable character of where it goes. Unfolding cannot occur except in a framework which allows the whole to go where it must go. The dire modern passion for planning and advance control must be replaced by an attitude which recognizes that openness to the future, and lack of predictability, is a condition for success. It must be alright for the thing to become whatever it becomes, under the influence of adaptation and feedback, even though one does not know, in detail, what that thing is going to be."
