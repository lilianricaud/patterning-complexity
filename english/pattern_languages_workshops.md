Action timeline


First, it appears that we had been making too much of the technical definition of "what is a pattern?" at the onset of the workshops. For that reason we began to structure the workshops more along the lines of a language immersion, hands-on approach than logical step-by-step explanation. Once people begin to work with the pattern cards, the concrete issues/opportunities in the area under focus somehow begin to make sense, in all their rich complexity, still a daunting challenge, but no longer a paralyzing conundrum. **Recognizing patterns at work and in context was far more immediately intuitive and useful than defining "pattern" in the abstract.**

Second, even using a representative stack of cards (well short of the full 136 patterns) provided enough of a sense of the whole to significantly broaden a team's perspective on its selected scenario. **The deck to a certain extent helped to address the natural limitations of "whoever happens to show up" by providing a framework of experience beyond the specific composition of any given team.**
