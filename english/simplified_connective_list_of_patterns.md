# SIMPLIFIED CONNECTIVE LIST OF PATTERNS

In practice, it is very cumbersome to work from a complete catalogue of discovered patterns to create a product. 

**A SIMPLIFIED CONNECTIVE LIST simplified connective list can drastically improve the utility of any pattern language**. A procedure for generating such a map is based on the conceptual 'chunking' of information (Miller, 1956). 

**The goal is to cluster patterns into groups of about five or fewer on each level of scale** ( PATTERNS HIERARCHICAL CONNECTION).  

Suppose one needs to design something using available patterns; pick those that are most relevant to the problem at hand, then choose not more than about a dozen related patterns from an existing patterns catalogue. 

Identify a vertical dimension (e.g. time, space, or group size) appropriate to the process that generates the end product, and study how the generative process develops as one moves up the levels of scale.  Once you assemble a group of patterns from a patterns catalogue, you can go back and develop others for related processes, which will include patterns left out in the initial round.

Pattern groups for different results should be separate, and not confuse each other's clarity.
