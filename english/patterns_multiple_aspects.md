# Patterns multiple aspects

Semiotic aspect of patterns:
Cognitive aspect of patterns:

Descriptive (observationnal) aspect of patterns: a thing, a configuration
Prescriptive: a rule that tells how to build the thing

Each one of these patterns is a morphological law, which establishes a set of relationships in space. (PATTERNS AS INVARIANTS IN FLUX).
 
And each law or pattern is itself a pattern of relationships among still other laws, which are themselves just patterns of relationships again. 
 
For though each pattern is itself apparently composed of smaller things which look like parts, of course, when we look closely at them, we see that these apparent "parts" are patterns too.
