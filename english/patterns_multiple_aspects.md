# Patterns multiple aspects

Semiotic aspect of patterns:
Cognitive aspect of patterns:

Descriptive (observational) aspect of patterns: a thing, a configuration
Prescriptive: (design pattern) a rule that tells how to build the thing

Each one of these patterns is a morphological law, which establishes a set of relationships in space. (PATTERNS AS INVARIANTS IN FLUX).
 
And each law or pattern is itself a pattern of relationships among still other laws, which are themselves just patterns of relationships again. 
 
For though each pattern is itself apparently composed of smaller things which look like parts, of course, when we look closely at them, we see that these apparent "parts" are patterns too. 

The smaller things that are patterns too, Alexander also called atoms or molecules from which a building or a town was made. 
 
In this logic, observational patterns could be used as elements descriptive/ formative of design pattern aspects: 
contexts, problems and driving forces, and system behaviors that justify a design, as well as desired configurations or quality, or systems as wholes; highlighting the generative processes at play and those to be produced. We could see patterns as heuristic 139 elements that help recognize, distinguish and describe the structures, behaviors and processes or mechanisms involved in what is in focus and at stake in complex systems, and identify the hidden ones. This could enable a comparison of actual system behaviors and states with ideal or desired ones. 
 
A problem in a context could be expressed as a set of patterns to transform. A solution, or desired systems behavior in a transformed context could be expressed similarly as a set of patterns to generate, they themselves generating emergent qualities. Other patterns aspects could be expressed as patterns also and be used as building blocks for other patterns, 

Then, there is of course the design pattern, the rule for design, and the generative processes that can guide a transformation from a set of patterns A (the current systems behavior, and the configuration and forces that drive it) to a set of patterns B (the desired future systems behavior, configuration and driving forces and the generative processes at various levels they may enable), composed into a larger design pattern, and then into a pattern language sequence or network, creating a system of design elements that function together to produce a design. 

Currently the ‘pattern’, is often seen as a ‘proven path’ from A to B. Introducing sense-making patterns at both the problem and solution level would help consider the problem, solution and transition pathway in more systemic and integrated ways.
