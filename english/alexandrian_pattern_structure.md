# ALEXANDRIAN PATTERNS

According to Alexander (1977) each pattern describes:
“a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice” (p. x).

Each of Alexander’s patterns contains the following
elements: 
- a name, 
- a number, 
- a picture, 
- an introductory
paragraph (sets the context and explains how the pattern helps complete larger patterns), 
- three diamonds (beginning of the problem), headline (the essence of the problem),
- body of the problem, 
- a solution, 
- a diagram, 
- three diamonds, and 
- references to smaller patterns that are needed to complete a pattern. 

The intention of a pattern language, according to Alexander, (1977) was to capture the heart of
solutions to recurring design problems in architecture and provide a process and a language that architects and non- architects could use to communicate.
