# PATTERN CONNECTIVE MAP

To visualize patterns and their interconnections (PATTERNS CONNECTIVITY), we use a graph representation. Patterns may be identified with nodes in a graph, and the graph is connected by edges of different lengths (Salingaros, 2000).

Use LAYERS to visualize connections accross LEVELS OF SCALE.

**One of the principal methods of validating a pattern language is that every pattern be connected vertically to patterns on both higher and lower levels.** (PATTERNS HIERARCHICAL CONNECTION).
