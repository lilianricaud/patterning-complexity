# QUALITY WITHOUT A NAME

## Salingaros

the “Quality Without A Name” — the QWAN, as it is known in computer science — which for practical purposes can, indeed, be named. It is the quality of a living environment. It describes systemic harmony, organized complexity, and coherence in our surroundings, and can be distinguished from crude mechanical principles that have dominated design in the machine age. It is present in structures that make us feel healthier whenever we are exposed to them. We receive sustenance from artifacts and settings that possess this healing property, which reflects the processes of biological reproduction and development. This healing process occurs in environments whose positive emotional quality comes from innumerable mutually reinforcing and psychologically nourishing interactions.

"Alive, whole, comfortable, free, egoless, eternal" cannot be defined precisely, always different yet objective quality.

Subtle kind of freedom from inner contradictions (TENSIONS).

Difference between:
- health / sickness 
- wholeness / dividedness
- self-maintainance / self-destruction

In a world which is alive, whole, healthy, people themselves can be alive and self-creating.

Subtle harmony between various forces of a (sub-)system, synergy where the forces/energies are used productivelly by the system leading to generative behaviors and not (self) destructive behaviors.

in tune with inner forces (fire, tiger, symphony...)

needs to be created with abandon.

circular: when it is around we can have it, when we have it we can generate it.
