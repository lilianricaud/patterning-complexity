## Difference between pattern languages and generative sequences

Pattern language = list of key centers contributing some essential quality to the system and list of relationships.

Note that the pattern language itself is a tool to plan and predict where to go but it doesn't tell the system's builder where to start. Together with 15 geometrical properties defined by Alexander, it can only be used as tool to validate good choice were made a posteriori.

Pattern language was a useful tool but it was too complex for most people because it lacked information about **when** to use each pattern. Later on Alexander brought the notion of generative sequence which he sees as a second generation of pattern languages.

> a structure is truly generated, and perceived as such, and perceived as having life, only when it has unfolded from a nice, beautiful sequence of differentiations â€” and this is perhaps the most important point of all. (alexander 2002b, p. 320)

_Effectivelly a **pattern** is a map of spatial relationships between sub-centers/elements (themselves being patterns/centers)._

_A **generative sequence** can be seen as a map of temporal relationships between patterns, ie when each patterns is deployed in the process to generate a coherent structure at each step._


## Difference between differentiating and assembling process

### Assembling process 
Start with elements (parts)...
assemble them...
into a whole...

This is a process of starting with parts then creating wholes by addition. 

This is the case when building a machine by assembling parts.

### Differentiating process

start with a whole ...
differentiate it ...
into parts ...

This is a process of starting with wholes then creating parts by differentiation.

This is the case when an embryo or a city emerges by step-by-step differentiation of the whole.

### Comparison

Modern design start with parts and assemble them by making connections. 

However for Alexander, the generation of a living structure starts from a whole with a latent potential where parts/centers (subwholes) emerges from a differentiating process.

This process can also be seen from the assembling perspective (see this article for interesting discussion: http://makingpermaculturestronger.net/2016/06/25/christopher-alexanders-challenge-meets-darren-j-dohertys-design-process-part-one-of-two/). 

But by taking the assembling lens/approach, there is a risk of missing the latent potential of a system .

If we try to assemble centers, we are limited in our capacity to do so and prone to make mistake, because there are too many variables to take into account. this is a problem often seen in permaculture design or in people following pattern language.
