# Emergence

emergence is a phenomenon whereby larger entities arise through interactions among smaller or simpler entities such that the larger entities exhibit properties the smaller/simpler entities do not exhibit.

"The whole is more than the sum of the parts"

Death is a process corresponding to the destruction of the emerging properties at various levels of the system.


Living architecture relies upon EMERGENCE. Spaces that feel the most alive, and catalyze the highest intensity of human life, are the result of emergence. This phenomenon requires that an enormous number of environmental forces align and collaborate to generate “flow”, “coherence”, or “wholeness” (QUALITY WITHOUT A NAME).

Three conditions are necessary for emergence to occur, although their presence does not guarantee it.
