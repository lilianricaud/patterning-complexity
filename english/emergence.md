# Emergence

emergence is a phenomenon whereby larger entities arise through interactions among smaller or simpler entities such that the larger entities exhibit properties the smaller/simpler entities do not exhibit.

"The whole is more than the sum of the parts"

Death is a process corresponding to the destruction of the emerging properties at various levels of the system.
