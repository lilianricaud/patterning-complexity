# Emergence

emergence is a phenomenon whereby larger entities arise through interactions among smaller or simpler entities such that the larger entities exhibit properties the smaller/simpler entities do not exhibit.

"The whole is more than the sum of the parts"

Death is a process corresponding to the destruction of the emerging properties at various levels of the system.


## Living architecture and emergence

Living architecture relies upon EMERGENCE. Spaces that feel the most alive, and catalyze the highest intensity of human life, are the result of emergence. This phenomenon requires that an enormous number of environmental forces align and collaborate to generate “flow”, “coherence”, or “wholeness” (QUALITY WITHOUT A NAME).

Three conditions are necessary for emergence to occur, although their presence does not guarantee it.

1. A tectonic framework of volumes and supports whose basic components are additive: i.e. the parts relate to each
other. In this setting, other, less permanent additive components can be introduced in a way that maintains
coherence.

2. An emotional connection established with spaces, details, and surfaces of the built environment, and with
other persons and life forms within that space. This requires a number of positive forces — above some threshold — coming from the surroundings.

3. The coordination and integration of all these forces. If many forces are randomly present and cancel each other,
they won’t lead to any emergence. For that to happen, the forces will have to be additive.
Since emergent properties arise from real interactions at the physical level, they are never evident in a building’s
rendering and construction drawings. You can control all the components of a design or building, and imagine that
everything together will combine into a harmonious whole, yet when it’s assembled, it has strange and surprising
qualities—sometimes interesting, but more often not good at all. Emergence could be positive or negative (while its
absence is neutral). The built space acquires a character of its own—either hostile, or welcoming—but never planned
for. The complex dynamic system, comprising building-plus-user, generates unexpected effects on the real scale. In the negative case, our visceral response to such emergent properties might turn out to be deleterious to our wellbeing and sensory experience of space.

## Emergence can't be controlled

It has been discovered in computer science and large electrical power grids that increasing complexity does tend
to nudge artificial systems slightly closer to organisms.
Emergent properties in very large complex networks and software make intervention tricky: beyond a certain high
threshold of complexity, those artificial systems begin to react in unexpected ways. Even though we build up their
complexity piecewise, the total complexity eventually becomes too large for us to grasp all at once. Interactions
that we never anticipated or programmed for could occur (Mehaffy & Salingaros, 2015; Salingaros, 2005).
Such a complex system somehow generates behavioral patterns. In those cases we (the system’s creators) must
switch from trying to understand exactly why the system behaves the way it does, to running rigorous tests that
make sure the system does what it’s supposed to do. This utilitarian approach reassures us that the system performs
its designated tasks as we try to understand and catalogue its emergent patterns. We accept some degree of emerging autonomy while instituting a separate pragmatic mechanism for checking out the system’s behavior.

Emergent phenomena in highly complex artificial systems should not be uncritically confused with the onset of
intelligence as occurs in organisms, however. This question is crucial to designing intelligent buildings. Evolved
responses consist of emergent properties that help an organism’s survival, and those have long-term value when
documented as patterns. Emergence in complex machines, on the other hand, acts randomly (like random mutations)
and in general doesn’t help anything. Emergence is useless without a selection mechanism in place that maintains
system coherence.
