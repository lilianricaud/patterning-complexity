# SEQUENCE OF PATTERNS USAGE

In which order shall we use patterns ?

3 conditions:
- if pattern A is above pattern B in the network of the language, then I must take A before I take B. This is the most fundamental rule. (SITTING ROOM > ALCOVE)
- I must take all the patterns immediately above A as close together in sequence as I can.
- I must take all the patterns immediatelly below the pattern A, as close together in sequence as I can.

The more a sequence of patterns meet these 3 conditions, the more coherent a person's image is.

Timeless way of building p 379.
