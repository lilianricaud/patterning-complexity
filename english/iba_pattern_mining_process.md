# Iba on pattern mining

## Pattern mining

First, it helps us to discover the common  patterns  drawn  from  individual  experiences.  At  the  end  of  the  clustering  process,  we  are  left  with multiple groups of sticky notes with similar contents. Simply stated, these are the patterns lurking beneath the multiple  experiences  and  cases

The second important role of clustering is to adjust the level of abstraction and granularity of the possible 
patterns.  Fragments  of  information  extracted  from  the  mining  dialog  usually  differ  in  terms  of  the  level  of abstraction  and  the  scale  of  contents. 

The  clustering  process  involves  deep  reflection  about  the  meaning  of  every  single  sticky  note.  It 
demands that we go beyond the superficial meaning of the words.

The opportunity for discussion provides the opportunity  to  obtain  a  common  understanding  of  the  patterns,  which  becomes  the  foundation  of  the  next activity, Pattern Writing.

### Starting from Chaos

This begins with writing down knowledge of practice (rules of thumb and tips) collected from the mining dialog sticky notes and placing them on the craft paper on the table at random.

### Talking while Moving

We then attempt to work out the essence of the contents  of  the  individual  sticky  notes  (Figure  2:  Hidden  Meanings)  by  bringing  together  those  notes  with similar contents. It is important to bear in mind that simply moving notes with existing classification standards  such as “-ish” and “-related” is not the purpose here.

### HIDDEN MEANINGS
the idea is to grasp the true meaning of what is written on the notes. 

### One-to-One Comparison

Compare pairs of notes individually to enrich comprehension of HIDDEN MEANINGS and start sthinking about CLUSTERS
When implementing this process, it is important to feel rather than to think logically. What is most important is to “genuinely listen to the essence of what each piece of paper is saying (HIDDEN MEANINGS). Cluster them based on the affinity of their essential meaning. They should not be clustered based on resemblance of what they superficially look like” 

### CLUSTERS

 The reason those 
five  pieces  of  paper  were  gathered  together  is  because  there  was  some  sort  of  feeling  of affinity. However, now looking at them for the second time, it is now necessary to read into the  five  pieces  of  paper  in  detail.  Read  thoroughly,  and  reconsider  logically  ‘why  these  five pieces of paper should be clustered together

Clustering should be done using a bottom-up approach involving every single sticky note, and **should never be performed to fulfill a preexisting categorization**. **This is the most important aspect of the KJ method**, which we discuss in greater detail later in this paper. 

Clustering  is  usually  carried  out  by  multiple  people  talking  to  each  other  and  moving  the  sticky  notes (Figure  2:  Talking  while  Moving).  While  some  groups  of  sticky  notes  will  be  generated  gradually,  doubt  may remain about what has been clustered, and it is important to check the clustered notes repeatedly. In the initial stages, it is normal that some notes do not fit the group in which they have been placed (Figure 2: Doubting Clusters).  


### ISLANDS

When  it  appears  that  the  classification  of  the  sticky  notes  makes  sense,  each  group  should  be circled  to  clearly  slow  the  “islands”  on  the  craft  paper  (Figure  2:  Discovering  the  Islands).  Each  island  then becomes a seed of pattern.
