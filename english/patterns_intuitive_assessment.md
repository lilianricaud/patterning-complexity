# PATTERNS INTUITIVE ASSESSMENT

Alexander based much of the validation for the Pattern Language on this intuitive assessment (Chapter 15 of The Timeless Way of Building [Alexander, 1 979]). which was dismissed as unscientific. 

But a graphic and theoretical basis underlies this. The smaller the scale on which a pattern acts, the more immediately it connects to human beings. Architectural patterns on the human range of scales 1 cm - 1 m create a visceral response because we can experience them with most of our senses. 

Larger patterns that cannot be touched or felt require synthesis and recognition; they become more intellectual. People who have not experienced them in person (in some region of the world where they still exist) can rarely imagine their emotional impact. This is the reason why the sequence small-to- large works in a validation process: it brings in the strongest personal connection at the beginning, and successive patterns build upon an intuitively accepted base.
