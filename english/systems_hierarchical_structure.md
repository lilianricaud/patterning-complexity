# SYSTEMS HIERACHICAL STRUCTURE

Every COMPLEX SYSTEM has a hierarchical structure; i.e., different processes are occurring on different scales or levels. Connections exist both on the same levels, and across level (Mesarovic, Macko et al., 1970). The same is true for a PATTERN LANGUAGE.

Higher levels in a system are dependent on all lower levels, but not vice-versa (Passioura, 1979). Each level in a complex hierarchical system is supported by the properties of the next-lower level.
