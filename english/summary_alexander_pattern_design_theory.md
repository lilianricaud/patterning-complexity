Christopher Alexander’s ‘first theory’ of architectural beauty was presented in his Harvard doctoral thesis and later published as Notes on the Synthesis of Form (Alexander 1964). The inspiration for this work is Alexander’s
belief that the buildings of traditional societies are inherently more beautiful than contemporary architecture.

Alexander alleges that this disparity arises from the use of radically different design processes. Traditional buildings are the product of a **communally-shared value system and piecemeal adaptation** to changing circumstances which brings all the ‘forces’ impacting a design into a harmonious balance. 

In contrast, contemporary architecture results from the **imposition of formal rules and abstract concepts upon a single design episode**, creating an outcome where the ‘forces’ are unbalanced. 

Alexander’s solution to this problem was a complex mathematical method for balancing all the ‘forces’ impacting a design.

When applied in practice, Alexander discovered that this process was too demanding for all but the largest design projects. However, Alexander also discovered that particular ensembles of ‘forces’ encapsulated generic situations that occurred repeatedly throughout the built environment,
and that resolving these forces would yield generic solutions that could be adapted to an infinite variety of specific circumstances (Broadbent 1980; Grabow 1983).

(...)

**Alexander’s second theory, itself a collaborative process**, was developed across three canonical books; The Oregon Experiment (Alexander et  al. 1975), A Pattern Language (Alexander et al. 1977) and The Timeless Way of
Building (Alexander 1979). Collectively these three works constitute one of the 1960s and 1970s most sustained criticisms of modernism.


During this era Bernard Rudofsky’s Architecture Without Architects (Rudofsky 1964), and Amos Rapoport’s House, Form and Culture (Rapoport 1969) and The Meaning of the Built Environment (Rapoport 1982) argued that **intuitive and unconscious processes were vital components of traditional and vernacular architecture** (Kohn 2002; Bhatt 2010). In a similar vein, Kevin Lynch’s The Image of the City (Lynch 1960) and Jane Jacobs’s The Death and Life of Great American Cities (Jacobs 1961), focused on **the importance of cognitive cohesion, vitality and piecemeal growth as part of a vibrant built environment** (Kohn 2002; Bhatt 2010). All of these concepts were central to Alexander’s second theory of architecture, which again focused on the inherent beauty of traditional urban spaces and buildings.


Alexander believes “[t]here is a central quality which is the root criterion of life and spirit in a man, a town, a building, or a wilderness. This quality is objective and precise, but it cannot be named” (Alexander 1979, p 19). The first volume of Alexander’s theory—The Timeless Way of Building—details his belief that this unnamed quality is the source of the inherent beauty of traditional architecture. 

Here it is argued that **the shared values and customs of traditional societies provide a guiding framework, or design language, that restrains the many small acts of individual construction and integrates them into a larger cohesive environment**. Despite being unnamed, Alexander proposed several descriptors for this quality— ‘beauty’, ‘alive’, ‘whole’, ‘comfortable’, ‘free’, ‘exact’, ‘egoless’, and ‘eternal’—and discusses how each captures certain dimensions of the quality, even though they are too imprecise to describe it perfectly.


Alexander argues that this quality exists, to some extent, in every individual, and this allows us to recognise its presence in the environment and each other. Thus, “the central scientific fact” (Alexander 1979, p 54) of
Alexander’s second theory of architecture is that **a strong reciprocal relationship exists between environments and their inhabitants**. 

The theory states that **places which exhibit this quality will awaken it in people, and people who have found the quality will embed it into the places they help to create**. Both people and places will become healthy, alive, whole, and self-maintaining if they have the ‘quality without a name’, and will be ‘sick’, ‘dead’, unwhole, and self-destroying without it.

According to Alexander **the ‘quality without a name’ is only created when people employ the timeless way of building**. This requires an ‘activated populace’ who participate in shaping their environment through a democratic process based on common traditions, a shared design language and a society-wide dialogue. 

However, Alexander also argues that the **traditional languages and values that once guided this process have been lost over time, or else have become so corrupted as to be utterly dysfunctional** (Salingaros 2000). Therefore, the second volume of the trilogy, A Pattern Language was intended to redress this issue by providing a replacement design language which forms the functional basis of Alexander’s theory.


A Pattern Language details 253 patterns which serve as generic guiding principles for design. “Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice” (Alexander et  al. 1977, p x). 

Patterns range in scale from regional planning through to interior design, and adapting their solutions to local circumstances and synthesising those into larger designs, ensures that all forces are balanced in a way that facilitates the emergence of ‘quality without a name’. In order to enable this synthesis, **each pattern in the language follows a consistent format of five sections**. 

First is its **identification, including name, number, confidence rating, and a photograph of a typical example**. 

Second is a **list of connections to other patterns it helps to complete**. 

The third section comprises a **description of the context in which the pattern is relevant and the empirical evidence that supports it**. 

The fourth section prescribes and diagrams the **actions required to ensure the emergence of the ‘quality without a name’** and the final section is a **list of other patterns that help to complete it**.

Alexander’s third volume—The Oregon Experiment— outlines the application of this theory in the design of a campus for the University of Oregon. This text focuses primarily on bureaucratic processes that are required to ensure that small scale projects and piecemeal development can occur in large scale projects for a single client.

Ultimately however, Alexander rejected his second theory of architectural beauty as he felt it had too little generative power and too little focus on geometry. 

Three decades later he proposed a **‘third theory’ of beauty, which replaced patterns with the generic concept of ‘centres’ and their transformations**, in addition to removing much of the neatly packaged social and architectural content that makes his second theory so compelling (Alexander 2002b, c, 2004, 2005; Adams and Tiesdall 2007). 

Despite rejecting his own second theory, it remains his Alexander’s most well-known work, and it continues to have an enduring influence and impact to the present day (Lea 1994; Alexander 1996; Saunders 2002b; Hermann 2004; Mehaffy 2008; Silva and Paraizo 2008).




Alexander’s canonical texts feature multiple barriers to those who wish to critically engage with his second theory, including the **lack of an explicit definition of a ‘pattern’ [5] leaving the term ambiguous and able to encapsulate multiple pre-formal concepts** (Lea 1994; Silva and Paraizo 2008). The concept of ‘forces’, which is central to both Alexander’s first and second theories of architecture, also lack formal definition in his canonical texts. The best explanations appear in Alexander’s secondary texts including The Atoms of Environmental Structure (Alexander and Poyner 1967), which implies that **forces are ‘tendencies’**, and From a set of Forces to a Form (Alexander 1966), where the only definition is found. However, even with access to these additional texts, the definition of a ‘force’ remains ambiguous with both ‘force’ and ‘tendency’ relying upon the other term in their definitions. This circular logic leaves the reader with only implicit definitions, pieced together from poetic examples of forces.


The fundamental premise that beautiful places can be created by synthesising patterns into larger wholes highlights two additional criticisms [8, 9] of Alexander’s documentation (Lang 1994). The first of these additional criticism is that Alexander’s canonical texts devote little attention to explaining that **the quality emerges from synthesising individual patterns into larger and more complete designs** [8] (Salingaros 2000; Saunders 2002a).

**This process of synthesis is guided by the connections between patterns which unite individual patterns into a cohesive language that effectively constitutes a large graph**. Yet, 38 years pass before the first attempt is made to analyse even a portion of this underlying graph structure (Park 2015).


The second additional criticism is that **Alexander’s documentation also fails to rigorously demonstrate the fundamental premise that beautiful environments are comprised of greater numbers of patterns than the contemporary designs which are allegedly destroying the world** [9]. 

This is significant because it has been argued that **one means of validating Alexander’s theory is to follow the sequence of patterns in reverse, to reveal emergent phenomena not contained in any individual pattern** (Salingaros 2000). However, this approach does not provide a link between beauty and the presence of patterns, a fact which is partially rectified in Alexander’s later work, A Foreshadowing of 21 st Century Art (Alexander 1993). Here ‘centres’ replace patterns as the source of beauty and Alexander demonstrates how the synthesis of these ‘centres’ can produce a larger ‘whole’ design, and that the most beautiful designs contain the greatest synthesis of these ‘centres.

**Alexander’s statements are not only provocative but also generalising and dogmatic [11], with a proselytising tone** (Broadbent 1980; Protzen 1980; Kohn 2002; Messina 2003; Walker 2003; Bhatt 2010) and they are presented in **texts that physically resemble a bible** (Broadbent 1980; Dovey 1990). These factors serve to evoke an air of authority that discourages dissent and critical engagement with Alexander’s theory, while reinforcing the notion that there is only one ‘right’ way of building.

Alexander’s low opinion of architects, and the barriers he placed in their way, are problematic because he still envisions them playing an important role as guides to A Pattern Language’s participatory design processes (Bobic 1996; Tanner 2000).

Alexander’s patterns serve as neatly packaged reminders of design wisdom that restrict architects and lay people to providing only those solutions that satisfy emotional and physical needs, while producing cohesive and contiguous environments (Davis 1983; Salingaros 2000; Saunders 2002a; Kalb 2014). However, the constraining
nature of Alexander’s patterns led scholars to criticise the theory for limiting the designer’s creativity [20] and preventing them from pursuing agendas that differ from his (Davis 1983; Dovey 1990; Messina 2003).

Surprisingly, only 2 criticisms [14, 28] (7%) relate directly to the pattern language concept rather than criticisms of Alexander’s ontological and epistemological positions, and these criticisms are amongst the more speculative.
As this mapping of criticisms shows, many perceived problems with Alexander’s theory are directly or indirectly connected to high level conceptual issues.


The thematic grouping of these issues indicates that Alexander’s theory: (i) embraces an ontology that confuses objective and subjective phenomena, rejects pluralistic values and alternate experiences, ignores political and social realities, and accepts only one ‘right’ way of building. This theory also (ii) depends on an idiosyncratic definition of ‘science’ that relies on ambiguous interpretations of what constitutes empirical research and eschews the scientific practices of rigorous testing and documentation.

The development of Alexander’s theory is criticised for: (i) failing to provide explicit definitions of terms, not engaging with scholarly literature, or providing traditional empirical validation for claims, and thereby failing
to meet expected standards of scholarly writing. It also (ii) fails to engage in rigorous testing of patterns, and (iii) includes significant examples of flawed reasoning and logical problems. The implementation of Alexander’s theory is also criticised for: (i) being overly controlling and restrictive, (ii) including flawed patterns and recommendations for design, and ultimately, (iii) failing to accomplish the intended goal of creating beautiful and whole designs.


Mapping criticisms into thematic groups reveals famil-
iar issues for those experienced with Alexander’s theory,
however this grouping of criticisms has not previously
been so explicitly identified. These considerations are
often overlooked by many readers of Alexander’s theory
who merely see a recipe book, of conveniently formatted,
seemingly well-intentioned, humanist solutions to the
challenges of contemporary design. Indeed, its popularity
amongst owner-builders and home designers may largely
reside in the fact that much of a pattern language remains
useful, even if the reader remains unaware of these criticisms. However, by explicitly mapping and group-
ing these criticisms into common themes, novice read-
ers may develop a deeper understanding of the theory’s
weaknesses. Meanwhile, veteran users of the language
may benefit from a deeper understanding of how prob-
lems encountered when attempting to design with the
language are connected to issues with the development
and conceptualisation of the theory.
**The identification and organisation of these criticisms suggests three possible directions for the future of pattern languages**. 

The first is to **consider A Pattern Language as a historical artefact worthy of further exploration**. 

The second **investigates the concept of pattern languages including whether or not they can be rigorously tested and whether they are practical design methodologies**, 

the third is **to develop new pattern languages without the restrictions of Alexander’s ontological and epistemological positions**.

This final avenue for research has **the potential to enable a paradigm shift** in
architectural theory, but **only if patterns can be rigorously tested**. Ultimately, the elusive nature of the ‘quality without a name’ may prevent the rigorous testing of patterns, however, even in this eventuality patterns remain
powerful phenomenological design tools “For the fact is most architects, most of the time, have worked according to patterns” (Broadbent 1980, p 252). 

While these patterns largely remain informal, Alexander’s second theory of architecture offers the potential to formalise complex phenomena into an easily digestible format which is accessible to non-professionals. Formalising patterns in this way may facilitate improved communication between architects and clients by providing each party with a deeper means of understanding the values and vision of the other.
