# PATTERNS VALIDATION

Quite separate from the internal validation offered by their ability to combine, what demonstrates the patterns' inevitability is their connection to fundamental patterns of human behaviour and movement. 

Many human functions and interactions are facilitated by the proposed urban geometry, and we could graphically link behavioural patterns to these architectural patterns directly. 

In most instances, this connection is revealed as an intuition that the patterns for urban boundaries 'feel right'. 

Alexander based much of the validation for the Pattern Language on this INTUITIVE ASSESSMENT.
