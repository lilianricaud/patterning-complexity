# TENSIONS

Misaligned forces in a system leading to self-destruction.

PATTERNING work is about FEELING where the tensions are and using them as a guide to understand the system, use INTERVENTIONS to add new PATTERNS in a STEP-BY-STEP manner, in order to perform STRUCTURE-PRESERVING TRANSFORMATIONS, eventually leading to increased LIFE and GENERATIVITY.
