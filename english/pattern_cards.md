Pattern languages are useful tools but because of their non-linear nature, they are not easy to manipulate in a linear book format. 

Therefore, 

Embed the patterns on cards that can be manipulated individually and combined as required.

For that, place the core of the pattern (problem and solution) on the back of a small card, with the name and an illustration on the front to make the card unique and distinguishable. Provide a way to find more detailled instructions about the pattern such as pattern source and number (or a QR code to link to a web ressource). 

Make printed cards only when you are sure you won't need to change the pattern, but while you mine the pattern make cards that are written with a pencil so you can refine the pattern as you use it.

In workshop settings, the cards' physical characteristics which make them easy to manipulate and the granular nature of pattern languages in general work together, making a strong tool for helping a group of people tackle a design challenge or a problem set. A team of four or five can quite quickly divide all 136 patterns among them and choose the most relevant patterns that relate to the task at hand. 

As the team reviews each others choices the group is able to refine their collective understanding of the task by affirming choices of others, questioning patterns that do not fit in their perception, and making a case for their own choices. This process not only narrows the range of patterns, but is an important step in fostering the collective intelligence of the team.

Fishkin and Luskin's work with deliberative polling (2005) provides strong evidence that as people gain information,
hear the opinions of others on a topic, and refine their own views through deliberation, that as a group opinions change and a sense of cooperation towards mutually beneficial solutions increase. In the simple exercise of sorting through the Liberating Voices pattern cards a group goes through a similar sequence to the deliberative polling process. The cards outline ideas that may not have been known to the individual, others ideas are presented to the group, and the individual tests their own ideas against the collective opinions of the group.
 
As the group understanding builds the pattern card quickly become shared ideas that can be referenced by the group and visually manipulated in relation to other ideas. By acting as common symbols a level of complexity can be dealt with that is often difficult with verbal language alone. (Schuller et al 2011).
