# ANTIPATTERNS APPROACH to pattern design  

Approach tried by Douglas Schuler and Justin Wagaman  The Surprising Power, Vitality, and Potentiality of Examining the “ Dark Side”.





The Collaborative Production of the Restraining Voices Anti-Pattern Language in an Educational Setting

In this project we actually tried to identify commonplace phenomena that are encouraging the degradation of the social and environmental worlds that we live in.  

The aim was not to create a comic book filled only with one-dimensional villains, but rather it was to create a set of patterns that were often morally dubious but realistic. 

The thought was that the more realistic and detailed our analysis / portrayal was, the easier it would be to develop a set of anti-anti- patterns (traditional patterns) that is designed to help counter the anti-patterns.  

Liberating  

Many of these patterns are enacted consciously, with someone deciding to enact them, but many more are carried out either without thought to the consequence or the collective impact — no one really sees the big picture until it is too late. This is the value that became clear when we were developing the anti-patterns. It shines a light on the process that is happening and once it is fully illuminated it is difficult to not see it everywhere.


With the Anti-Pattern project we realized fairly early on that we should make it one of our top priorities to not document them as if we think they are “Bad.” Nor should we write them as if they were “Good,” either. We tried to write them in a neutral and informative style with as little bias as possible regardless of our feelings toward the various behaviors discussed in the patterns. If someone wanted to try to recreate the Cultural Imperialism pattern from our work, he or she could play a role in perpetuating it.

### set of descriptors used for each pattern  

These descriptors were: Description, How it Works, Evidence, Linked Patterns, and References.  

### Mining Process  

To create a first draft of this language within the 10-week quarter, we went through a process that proceeded incrementally according to the demands of the project at the time. 

We generated lots of possible patterns, convened small and large discussions, contributed to the project Wiki, added descriptive images from the public domain, and, finally, arranged, grouped, and categorized the anti-patterns.

<!--- Ultimately we identified three fundamental anti-patterns, Civic Ignorance, Violence, and Environmental Degradation, and over 30 others, which we arranged roughly from biggest to smallest, similarly to both of our model pattern languages. --->  

We started by generating a large list of anti- patterns in several group brainstorm sessions. This list was whittled down over the course of the next couple of weeks in seminar groups and much discussion. To get the initial list of approximation of one hundred patterns we voted for our top ten patterns and kept the 35 most popular as the first set.

<!--- The patterns that made it ran the gambit from more serious issues such as Racism and Societal Apathy, humorous titles like Weapons of Mass Distraction and more subtle issues such as Focus on Deficiencies and Mock Public Space.--->  

This first set of patterns was placed on the Evergreen State College Wiki site. Each pattern was given a wiki page so that students could work collaboratively on each pattern and see the changes instantly. We found that a Wiki was perfect for this type of collaborative project, as each contributor could see their work instantly reflected on the site in that clean and familiar wiki style. Changes could be easily tracked and entire sections rolled back in case of any mistakes. We were also able to watch the work grow in real time.  

Although we developed a single anti-pattern language we often worked individually and in small groups. Each group would try to identify approaches that work best for them — and for the larger group. The whole group also got together several times during the quarter to help ensure that there was broad coverage and that there wasn’t duplication of effort. It turned out that one group sometimes developed patterns based on suggestions from another group. Also, certain students were better at different tasks like finding research, others better at writing or brainstorming, and others were better at layout and design or in editing and forming the wiki. 

By encouraging collaboration and sharing of knowledge we were able to better utilize the strengths of the group to create something that would have been difficult for a small group of students working on their own. 

To further encourage and utilize the collective intelligence of the group, two students were assigned to each anti-pattern we selected and each anti-pattern was worked on by a different set of students so the same two students were not assigned more than one anti-pattern.  Each pattern was illustrated with at least one graphic, photograph, or illustration that was representative of the pattern (and others to illustrate other aspects of the pattern as desired). 

All graphics that we used in the project were public domain, open source, and/or an appropriate creative commons license that allows free publishing. The use of public domain photos was very helpful, due to our limited time on the project, but it could sometimes result in a very long process to find a suitable photograph or illustration for our needs.  Since this is a pattern language project, we set out, not in developing a random set of patterns, but — hopefully — a coherent set of well thought out patterns that are mutually generative and constitute a holistic language. To that end, we decided to group the patterns by their place and their use within the social landscape. These groups were Cultural, Societal, Institutional, Tactics, Media, and Results. 

The final overarching group was the group that we thought belonged at the top of the pyramid (so to speak). This final group was called Fundamental Evils, and it contained the three most general anti-patterns of our project: Civic Ignorance, Violence, and Environmental Degradation. 

We were always aiming for quality but given the time constraints, not necessarily completeness of individual patterns. We were, however, looking for broad coverage of patterns. This might mean that additional anti-patterns were identified by name but not yet fleshed out because of time constraints. These patterns were cataloged on the wiki for reference and so that they can be looked at and selected for future addition to the pattern language. 	

Patterns need to be reasonably generic, timeless, logical, and supported by evidence. Patterns also have an established structure: title, introductory graphic, problem, context, discussion, diagram, and solution. Ours don’t need to have each one of these explicitly, but they should contain at least hints of all of them. And we are likely to have the notion of a full pattern language as well as pattern cards, which contain only sketches. 

The first draft of the project was completed on the last day of spring quarter, approximately 10 weeks after it started. The fact that a workable pattern language was created collaboratively over a 10-week period is a testament to the pattern/ pattern language form.  

In the following quarter (Fall, 2013), Justin Wagaman, with help from colleagues, developed a short description for each anti-pattern and a suitable descriptive image in the public domain. The text and images were packed into physical cards that were presented at the PUARL conference in 2013. The cards are available without cost online and we are integrating them into a collaborative pattern language project this quarter (winter 2014).  

## INTERVENTIONS to heal anti-patterns

The identification of an anti-pattern is a type of declaration or assertion. In a general way, the developers of the anti-patterns are stating that these and the language that contains them are bad. While not unequivocally evil (or, more practically, measurable or otherwise easily precisely defined) they are asserted to represent powerful social forces that are generally destructive and, hence, implicitly (at least) should be resisted. While we believe that the development of the anti-pattern language was a significant step, its usefulness would be best demonstrated if and when it helps inform the development of resistance to the anti-patterns.  

We are using the idea of interventions as a way to explore the existing and potential forms that this resistance could take. Interventions in this context are responses to social processes that are deemed to be undesirable. Interventions are intended to block or otherwise deflect or dilute the processes described by the anti-patterns, to force detours from the courses that would have been taken had it been allowed to function in their customary operational fashion.  

 There two phenomena that are commonly identified as interventions (at least in the United States). The first, military intervention, is an armed response to a coup or other event. The second intervention is closer to home. An intervention is an action that is enacted by friends and family members (often with assistance from professional social workers or clergy members) to confront a loved one through a dramatic show of opposition to that person’s destructive behavior, generally involving alcohol or other addictive drugs.  

The two examples above, however, have implications that get in the way of the way we need to view interventions.

Both suggest that **interventions are events rather than ongoing processes**. They also suggest that **interventions focus on one level of engagement, not on several simultaneously, nor are they coordinated with others**.

Finally, the canonical examples above also prevent us from realizing that interventions are ubiquitous and that they are therefore more or-less commonplace. Taking an aspirin for a headache is an everyday intervention. Education is an intervention against ignorance and a soup kitchen is an intervention against starvation or disease. 

Interventions are not merely disruptions. 

**Interventions in the general sense (a meaning that we’d like to preserve) are calculated responses based on study and analysis.**  

Although the processes described in our anti- patterns are, unfortunately, “eternal” — as are the set of sustained, diverse, and often lost-to-history counter-processes, “interventions” and other responses to the anti-patterns — we don’t believe that they’re inevitable or permanent, at least at their current levels. We believe that focusing on the anti-patterns and the subsequent development of interventions can result in positive social and environmental change.  Each pattern represents a variety of interrelated research chores and hypotheses. 

The structure we’ve adopted includes a “how it works” field (mechanisms) and an “evidence” field, both of which challenge us to support our claim that we’ve successfully identified significant anti- patterns. 

**Because each pattern in the set (or language) contains links to other patterns, a complex set of hypotheses is created**. The key to developing successful interventions may lie in analysis; careful inquiry as to the systemic linkages of the anti-patterns at all levels.  The mechanisms described in each of the linked patterns should feed into each other. A mismatch of the mechanisms could suggest that the anti-patterns are not linked. 

Finally, while we have not spent much time directly considering this, the interplay between the patterns and the anti-patterns that we’re engaged with, is a strongly dialectic process, which we hope will help in productive thinking and acting in relation to social engagement.  

## Pedagogical benefits  

As has been asserted previously (Schuler, 2010), the pattern language structure is particularly well structured for promoting wide-ranging explorations and representing complex circumstances. The “forcing function” nature of the structure (the problem / solution relationship, e.g.) helps people generate multiple hypotheses to be examined and tested. 

This extends to the development of interventions which we believe are key to the value of this project. This approach allows students to devise their own research path that allows more freedom than the more structured and codified approaches do not allow. Pursued diligently using the built-in dictates of the pattern / pattern language approach, and with appropriate faculty guidance this approach is not less rigorous (or scientific) than traditional approaches. 

The rigor here is forced upon us because each anti-pattern is, in essence, a hypothesis, and the evidence and the mechanisms  need to be identified in order for it to be legitimate. Beyond the individual pattern, the pattern language, the network of interrelations among patterns presents another wide set of questions to be addressed through research and inquiry.  

We’re still trying to figure out why this is exciting — and what are the pedagogical implications? Some of the possible reasons include obtaining satisfactory results in a very short period of time. And, the quick assembly coupled with the perceived magnitude of the findings and the somewhat unexpected coming together of the project from seemingly disconnected efforts may also have contributed. Also, finally, the incongruously liberatory nature of actually naming names and pulling back the curtain on social ills was also satisfying. 

As a matter of fact, engaging people in a dialectic “game” which does not necessarily lead down the professor’s preferred garden path, is likely to be more inspiring, more open to insight and team learning, more likely to inspire a love of learning and self-efficacy in that direction, and, in general, more appropriate for people who find themselves existing in the “real” (i.e. non-academic) world.  

There are other interesting research questions that this project has helped surface. For example, is it easier to identify anti-patterns than the traditional patterns put forward by Alexander et al (1978)? This makes intuitive sense because the “solutions” to the anti-patterns have apparently not been wholly successful. 

This also suggests in an indirect way that the “solutions” — the patterns in the APL sense — aren’t as readily discoverable. They may also be too numerous to list because there is unlikely to be one grand scheme that erases the problems. Also, because many of the problems in this realm have persisted so long, it may be the case that they are truly timeless.

We are relatively pleased with our current product (the draft anti-pattern language and a set of anti-pattern cards) and believe that we have sketched a broad portrait for many of the timeless patterns that perpetuate unhealthy dominance over people and the natural environment. But although we were quite happy with the initial result that had developed so quickly and somewhat effortlessly, it could easily be argued that the “real work” is now beginning.  An important part of this work includes a systematic probe of each anti-pattern as well as a check on the validity of the set of anti-patterns as a pattern language. And each set of validation tests, as well as the processes to redress any shortcomings, are different for each focus. Other interesting roles have been advanced, many related to our 2012 paper (Schuler et al). These include leveraging the potential for interaction in the online environment in many ways including annotation. We are also interested in using them in games or workshops, and to counterpoise them with the Liberating Voices patterns to see how the two can help inform each other.  Along similar lines, my students and I have just initiated (winter quarter 2014) a somewhat open- ended process to develop 7-20 pattern languages (first drafts, that is) in a variety of domains, primarily of the student’s choosing. The themes of community health, gardening, native education, bliss and eight others have been proposed so far. Although it’s too early to say anything definitive, we intend to integrate the anti-patterns into the project, probably by incorporating them into the problem statements. We also intend to explore how the various pattern languages can be connected, possibly into one knowledge complex that may or may not ultimately take the form of a traditional pattern language.  Even if our pattern language was more developed, the work wouldn’t stop there. The idea is not to sit on the sidelines and watch the anti-patterns continue their inexorable reiteration of violence and oppression as if life on earth was a movie. The anti-pattern work and the interventions that we hope to identify will need to connect to key efforts in other sectors including political and social engagement, policy development, media access, and the built environment. To some degree, the set of anti- patterns we’ve developed could provide inspiration and support — if not the backbone — for a broad participatory project.
