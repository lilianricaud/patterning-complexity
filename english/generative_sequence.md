# Generative sequence / Sequence of unfolding

A generative sequence may be thought of as a second generation pattern language.

In A Pattern Language, published in 1977, the emphasis is on the patterns
themselves...that is, on the content of the patterns. Although we intended that the pattern language would be generative, that is, would allow people to generate buildings and building designs, for themselves—truthfully, this does not happen. The patterns provide many profound ideas, and geometrical "nuggets": which are needed to make the environment work.

But, as written in 1977, they do not actually allow a person to generate a good design, step by step. The do not place the emphasis on morphological unfolding, as they should.

Yet in traditional society, the pattern languages which people had did place the emphasis on morphological unfolding. With the help of the generative sequences (or languages) that people had from their culture, they were able to make beautiful and useful things, almost without thinking, because the creative power lay in the generative structure of the
language—and that lay in the sequence in which the steps were to be performed.

The essence of the sequences which we shall introduce on this website, is that they give people power, to make beautiful and workable designs. You do not need to scratch you head. You just need to use the sequence in the right order, and you will get good results.

This will have two big effects on the design of buildings:
1. An architect who uses such a sequence, can do better and more beautiful work.
2. A lay person can make a design, at least in a simple form, where previously it was
assumed that only architects and engineers could make designs

The sequence is organized so that the form unfold coherently, and allow all the necessary PATTERNS to appear in the finished structure.

Traditional sequence also created the form, geometry, style so that the whole had deep coherence.

A GENERATIVE SEQUENCE leads to a DIFFERENTIATING PROCESS of the WHOLE via STEP-BY-STEP ADAPTATION resulting in a GENERATED STRUCTURE.

Tribal society used generative sequence to build: for example in the pacific island, oral societies used song to map the different step to build a canoo:
- go to the forest
- find a certain kind of tree with certain kind of dimensions
- cut it down
- dig the inside
- make the front beatiful
- ...

The sequence can be followed by almost anyone and lead to a successful construction at the end.

Molisson reports tribal used songs in a similar way to encode sequence for navigating the land (aborigenes) or the ocean (polynesia).

Cooking recipes can be seen as generative sequence for making food, with various recipes using various ingrdeients/patterns and reaching certain kind of patterns at end (SWEET/SOUR, FRESH HERBS/COCONUT SAUCE...)

Generative sequence are themselves complex adaptative systems and cannot be fabricated but must generated step by step to become alive.
