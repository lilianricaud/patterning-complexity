# PATTERN LANGUAGE

A pattern language is more than just a PATTERN catalogue. 

The LANGUAGE NATURE OF PATTERN LANGUAGES combines the nodes (PATTERNS) into an organizational framework, a COMPLEX SYSTEM where each pattern is linked to several other patterns in a generative manner.

As a complex system, a pattern language cannot be fabricated and must be generated using a GENERATIVE SEQUENCE (GENERATIVE SEQUENCE FOR PATTERN LANGUAGE GENERATION).

Check for PATTERN LANGUAGES STRUCTURAL COHERENCE and PATTERNS HIERARCHICAL CONNECTION.



if you want to influence the structure of your town, you must help to change the underlying languages. It is useless to be innovative in an individual building, or an individual plan, if this innovation does not become part of a living pattern language everyone can use.
