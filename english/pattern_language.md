# PATTERN LANGUAGE

Pattern language is a design method and framework devised by architect Christopher Alexander and built around the concept of PATTERN. 

Pattern languages encapsulate human experience, and help us cope with complexity in our environment. They apply to everything from computer programs, to buildings, to organizations, to cities. **A civilization's pattern languages are often synonymous with its technical and cultural heritage.** New spheres of human endeavour develop their own pattern language, which must link to existing pattern languages in related fields. Individual patterns are validated empirically over time.

In practice, pattern languages arise from two very different needs: (a) as a way of understanding, and possibly controlling, a complex system; (b) as necessary design tools with which to build something that is functionally and structurally coherent. 

A pattern language is more than just a PATTERN catalogue. 

The LANGUAGE NATURE OF PATTERN LANGUAGES combines the nodes (PATTERNS) into an organizational framework, a COMPLEX SYSTEM where each pattern is linked to several other patterns in a generative manner (PATTERNS CONNECTIVITY).

As a complex system, a pattern language cannot be fabricated and must be generated using a GENERATIVE SEQUENCE (GENERATIVE SEQUENCE FOR PATTERN LANGUAGE GENERATION).

It is essential that any pattern language link to existing languages at its boundaries

if you want to influence the structure of your town, you must help to change the underlying languages. It is useless to be innovative in an individual building, or an individual plan, if this innovation does not become part of a living pattern language everyone can use.
