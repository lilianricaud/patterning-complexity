# Salingaros design method

The design method in practice.

## Harvest users feelings

One first holds preliminary discussions with residents of
any region to establish the major, i.e., most significant
patterns for them. This could be by consensus or via a
majority vote, but only after some discussion to "mine" for
patterns hidden in the residents' subconscious. For
example, in designing the Eishin School Campus in Tokyo,
Alexander found to his surprise that most teachers and
students interviewed put a lake as their top priority. He
then built an artificial lake, and this feature is what
makes the school most extraordinary. An insensitive
architect and contractor would have dismissed this wish as outrageous, and actually, some interviewees were
initially afraid to express their vision of the lake, because
they feared that it was too crazy to even mention.

## Draft pattern language

Once the residents' deepest wishes are noted, then the
architects have to come up with patterns to express those
desires written in pattern format, as in A Pattern
Language 1 . If such high-priority patterns are not already
documented in the pattern language, they have to be
researched by looking at the most beautiful examples in
existence around the world, and identifying what makes
those examples so successful. It could be geometry,
position, connectivity, or a relationship to other patterns.
In the meantime, the architects should have picked out a
dozen documented Alexandrine patterns that are most
relevant to the job at hand. These are going to be
presented to the residents in pictorial form.

## Educate users about Alexander's most important patterns

The next step is to hold an educational session with the
residents, and to teach them the twelve most important
Alexandrine patterns that apply to their project. To these
are going to be added any additional patterns that come
from the residents themselves. The rest of the work
involves combining all the patterns together in many
different ways, and judging the end results. Here,
enormous work is saved if one can do the simulations on
a computer, and view the results graphically.
Unfortunately, most existing software gives a very sterile
picture of designed environments, which is totally useless
for judging the life that a particular solution will have
when built.
