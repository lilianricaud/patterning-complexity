# Salingaros design method

The design method used by Salingaros in practice (Salingaros 2017).

## Harvest users feelings

One first holds preliminary discussions with residents of any region to establish the major, i.e., most significant patterns for them. This could be by consensus or via a majority vote, but only after some discussion to "mine" for patterns hidden in the residents' subconscious. For example, in designing the Eishin School Campus in Tokyo, Alexander found to his surprise that most teachers and students interviewed put a lake as their top priority. He then built an artificial lake, and this feature is what makes the school most extraordinary. An insensitive architect and contractor would have dismissed this wish as outrageous, and actually, some interviewees were initially afraid to express their vision of the lake, because they feared that it was too crazy to even mention.

### Use emotions in design

In his projects, Alexander experienced again and again the emotional dimension of design when trying to "mine"
for patterns. For example, in preparing for the Eishin School outside Tokyo, he asked the teachers and staff to
imagine the most beautiful environment to teach in. At first they thought it was a joke, but then became very
emotional when they related visions of walking along a lake between classes, and concluded that encouraging
such a dream was cruel because it was incompatible with contemporary fortress-like concrete schools in an urban
setting. At another occasion, in designing a new community at Chikusadai, Nagoya, also in Japan, he asked families to actually draw the plan of their house.

While they were doing so, many of them cried out of emotion, since they had expected to be given a standard
fixed, or at best a modular design. There is simply no way to decide on geometry -- whether the shape of a building, the shape of a path, or the relationship between two structures -- without using emotions. The human brain is the world's most sophisticated and powerful computer, and it alone is capable of making the astronomical number of parallel computations needed to decide the best position for placing an object. Forget the simplistic method of alignment to an artificial rectangular grid: it is the easy way out for architects who wish to avoid difficult decisions. In designing the Eishin campus, Alexander had people holding flags on poles move around the site so as to experience the best position for the planned buildings.

In the words of the client, the headmaster Mr. Hosoi: "We could feel the actual buildings ... standing there"

## Draft pattern language

Once the residents' deepest wishes are noted, then the architects have to come up with patterns to express those desires written in pattern format, as in A Pattern Language 1 . If such high-priority patterns are not already documented in the pattern language, they have to be researched by looking at the most beautiful examples in existence around the world, and identifying what makes those examples so successful. It could be geometry, position, connectivity, or a relationship to other patterns. In the meantime, the architects should have picked out a dozen documented Alexandrine patterns that are most relevant to the job at hand. These are going to be presented to the residents in pictorial form.

## Educate users about Alexander's most important patterns

The next step is to hold an educational session with the residents, and to teach them the twelve most important Alexandrine patterns that apply to their project. To these are going to be added any additional patterns that come from the residents themselves. The rest of the work involves combining all the patterns together in many different ways, and judging the end results. Here, enormous work is saved if one can do the simulations on a computer, and view the results graphically. Unfortunately, most existing software gives a very sterile picture of designed environments, which is totally useless for judging the life that a particular solution will have
when built.

## Work out critical choices with pionners

For practical reasons, the completion of the project will be in the hands of the planner/architect, with one or two residents closely participating until the end. These residents may be individuals who take a more intense interest in urban design, and can be expected to represent the entire community. It is not suggested that any more collective group decisions be made, as different members of the group will certainly diverge in details and preferences, and the project will then be delayed indefinitely. The input, and even veto power, occurs in the major patterns in the beginning, which is precisely where the most damage can be done by insensitive planning.


## Refine patterns (using STRUCTURE-PRESERVING TRANSFORMATION)

Another point is that, as the design process progresses, many more patterns will have to be brought into play as things get built on different scales. The project becomes more complex because of the increasing number of possible pattern combinations, and quick decisions will have to be made. Many of these will be driven by competing technical, practical, and legal considerations. As long as the scientific principles of patterns and their combinatorics are respected, however, one can choose equally well from among an infinity of different choices, all of which will lead to a successful result.

## Work recursively at various scales

The great power of this method is that it is recursive on smaller scales. That is, once the largest scale is decided
upon, individual regions on the next smaller scales may be tackled. One works with about five patterns to solve a
specific design problem. The number five comes from a "chunk" of disparate pieces of information that the mind
can juggle simultaneously 3 . Again, one can choose from among the original Alexandrine patterns, or if required, a
new pattern is derived for the occasion.

## Preserve what is most valuable.

In urban restructuring, it is essential to preserve what has most life in the existing environment. Because of the
infection by mind-viruses discussed later, it is almost always the case that urban renewal destroys the few
objects and places that have life in any neighborhood. It is therefore necessary to identify these by common consent, and to put a priority on preserving them so that they are saved intact in any new plan. Examples of failing
to do this abound around the world. In one instance, the Indonesian Government rebuilt an entire village that was
destroyed in an earthquake. The planners ignored the traditional sacred places in the old village, with nothing 
to take their place in the new village. The result was a loss of culture and identity, with a severe disorientation and cultural breakdown.

It is the people themselves, infected with anti-patterns from the media and education, that usually want to
eliminate their most sacred urban places. Those are incorrectly identified with the past, and with a way of life
that most residents are ashamed of and wish to erase. People are frequently seduced by empty images of
prosperity that they have ingested from magazines, and imagine that if only their environment would look like
empty North American suburbs, they too can aspire to a high standard of living.

The computer scientist Thomas Erickson 4 has reached the same conclusion. He reviews the work of the urbanist
Randolph Hester 5 in revitalizing the town of Manteo, North Carolina. Although not originally expressed in
those terms, Hester and his team "mined" for socio-urban patterns important to that community before rebuilding
anything. These had to be observed directly, since no-one talked about them. Once this "sacred structure" was
identified, all construction was aimed at reinforcing rather than destroying it. What is important here is that
the town's sacred structure was not composed of any building or urban construction that would be classed as
"important" according to current architectural and urban criteria. Architecturally, the town's "sacred structure"
was a network of negligible and insignificant places, buildings, and bits of built form -- this nevertheless
provided a matrix for the life of the town. By following this plan, the town was extremely successful in
regenerating itself
