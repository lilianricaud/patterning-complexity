# Pattern language as augmented language

pattern languages could be seen as a proto language, a systemic language, with more ‘performing’ or ‘systems behavior generating’ powers than natural spoken language, and with 
less assumed shared meaning. A sort of “perceptual code” used to describe, and simulate, if not enact, in adaptive ways,  the  systemic  workings  of  the  world,  bringing the  focus  on  processes  and  networks  of  complex  systems interrelationships and their manifestations, rather than on categories, and how things are named by convention.

Such approach would enable, as suggested by Henshaw 66 , to focus attention more directly on individual subjects and organizational designs of nature, and their overlaps, cross-linkages, and ambiguities, rather than on invented categories. Such pattern languages become a medium for systemic conversation and mediation, with patterns used as boundary objects or object of research within and across different interpretation and representation world

We can see patterns, in their broadest definitions, as units of ‘meaning-making’, which enable both the decoding (understanding), and the encoding (design or transformation) of systems characteristics, in a heuristic participative way.
