# Pattern language theory antipatterns

Seems both Alexander and Molisson were on the right track but, possibly because the had to fight to bring their theories to life in the 70s, they used provocative and dogmatic tone that might have useful to be understood by early adopters but were damaging to the adoption of their theory beyond pioneers/early adopters. Here's a mapping of Alexander antipatterns.

## PROVOCATIVE STATEMENTS

**Alexander’s statements are not only provocative but also generalising and dogmatic [11], with a proselytising tone** (Broadbent 1980; Protzen 1980; Kohn 2002; Messina 2003; Walker 2003; Bhatt 2010) and they are presented in **texts that physically resemble a bible** (Broadbent 1980; Dovey 1990). These factors serve to evoke an air of authority that discourages dissent and critical engagement with Alexander’s theory, while reinforcing the notion that there is only one ‘right’ way of building.

## PROSELYTING TONE

an air of authority that discourages dissent and critical engagement with Alexander’s theory, while reinforcing
the notion that there is only one ‘right’ way of building.
Alexander’s low opinion of architects, and the barriers he placed in their way, are problematic because he still
envisions them playing an important role as guides to A Pattern Language’s participatory design processes (Bobic
1996; Tanner 2000). Ironically, the authoritative tone results in his work resembling self-help books which
serves to inspire confidence among non-professionals and is suggested to partially explain the widespread pop-
ularity of A Pattern Language (Bhatt 2010).

## BIBLE STYLE BOOK

the books look like a bible or some sort of religious book, which doesn't serve a scientific function.

## PARTIAL TRADITIONNAL SCIENTIFIC METHOD

Alexander appears to desire the epistemological
strength of the scientific method, but wishes to exclude
the dualistic foundation that separates mind and body
(Dovey 1990).

## AMBIVALENT EMPIRICAL NOTION

## AMBIGUOUS PATTERN NOTION

## AMBIGUOUS FORCES NOTION

## TESTING DIFFICULTY

the majority of Alexander’s patterns have never truly been tested [14]. This is because patterns early in the language require the reorganisation of socio-economic systems and the connected nature of patterns may mean that individual patterns can never be tested in isolation (Protzen 1980; Salingaros 2000). Unlike most criticisms, the potential un-testability of patterns and their languages has no antecedent in the conceptualisation of Alexander’s theory.
This is a criticism of the pattern language concept, which would apply to every pattern language, and **the difficulty that testing a language presents, would scale proportionately with the size of each language**.

## UTOPIC IDEAL CONDITIONS


Alexander’s insistence on returning to pre-industrial production modalities [16] comprises three examples of
flawed reasoning. First, this insistence arises from Alexander’s vision of a society of pure freedom and is to be
achieved through an activated populace reshaping their environment through bottom-up, grass roots processes.

This pre-industrial language demands hand-crafting, piecemeal development, the de-commodification of land,
and an absence of external controls. However, Anders Duany—a founder of The Congress for the New Urbanism, an organisation established to implement ideas of Alexander and Jane Jacobs—argues that grass roots
process are insufficient to achieve to achieve the scale of change Alexander requires. 

This scale of change is only possible with top down control and the guidance of expert leaders, a role that Alexander typically fulfils in his own projects (Mehaffy 2004, 2008). Second, the pre-industrial production methods including  a retreat from labour specialisation is unlikely to achieve a level of productivity sufficient to support a modern society. 

Finally,if Alexander’s patterns are to be successful they must be compatible with contemporary society, which includes the ability to profit monetarily from one’s endeavours, and Alexander’s insistence on the de-commodification land runs counter to this requirement (Dovey 1990).

Critics point to Alexander’s insistence on forcing these requirements on a modern society as symptomatic of
an ontology that ignores social, political and economic realities that establishes a connection between problems
with the development and conceptualisation of the theory (Montgomery 1970; Dovey 1990; Salingaros 2000;
Elsheshtawy 2001; Saunders 2002a). Meanwhile flawed reasoning also produces patterns that are incompatible
with contemporary society and establishes a connection to problems with the implementation of the language.

## TYRANNICAL-PERCIEVED THEORY

In effect, Alexander’s proposal is to replace the theory and practice of modernism (which he rejects as totalitarian and controlling) with an alternative, yet equally tyrannical romanticism (Protzen 1980; Saunders 2002a).

*critic dontunderstand that Alexander does not promote his rules, but the rules of the timeless way*

## INSUFFICIENT EXPLANATIONS

Alexander’s careful analysis and explanation of how traditional environments arise is insufficient to restore those qualities through his own, highly systemised design process [18].
