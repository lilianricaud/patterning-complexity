# Differentiating process

The key to complex adaptationâ€¦ lies in the concept of differentiation. This is a process of dividing and differentiating a whole to get the parts, rather than adding parts together to get a whole (Alexander, 2002b, p. 197)

Alexander emphasize that the WHOLE is not a combination of PARTS, but rather in natural systems the PARTS emerge from differentiation of the WHOLE using a STEP-BY-STEP ADAPTATION, where each parts becomes itself slowly more differentiated and complex.

the differentiation process comes from GENERATIVE SEQUENCE.
