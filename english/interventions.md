## INTERVENTIONS to heal anti-patterns


Schuler and Wagaman (2013) are using the idea of interventions as a way to explore the existing and potential forms that this resistance could take. Interventions in this context are responses to social processes that are deemed to be undesirable. Interventions are intended to block or otherwise deflect or dilute the processes described by the anti-patterns, to force detours from the courses that would have been taken had it been allowed to function in their customary operational fashion.  

 There two phenomena that are commonly identified as interventions (at least in the United States). The first, military intervention, is an armed response to a coup or other event. The second intervention is closer to home. An intervention is an action that is enacted by friends and family members (often with assistance from professional social workers or clergy members) to confront a loved one through a dramatic show of opposition to that person’s destructive behavior, generally involving alcohol or other addictive drugs.  

The two examples above, however, have implications that get in the way of the way we need to view interventions.

Both suggest that **interventions are events rather than ongoing processes**. They also suggest that **interventions focus on one level of engagement, not on several simultaneously, nor are they coordinated with others**.

Finally, the canonical examples above also prevent us from realizing that interventions are ubiquitous and that they are therefore more or-less commonplace. Taking an aspirin for a headache is an everyday intervention. Education is an intervention against ignorance and a soup kitchen is an intervention against starvation or disease. 

Interventions are not merely disruptions. 

**Interventions in the general sense (a meaning that we’d like to preserve) are calculated responses based on study and analysis.**  

Although the processes described in our anti- patterns are, unfortunately, “eternal” — as are the set of sustained, diverse, and often lost-to-history counter-processes, “interventions” and other responses to the anti-patterns — we don’t believe that they’re inevitable or permanent, at least at their current levels. We believe that focusing on the anti-patterns and the subsequent development of interventions can result in positive social and environmental change.  Each pattern represents a variety of interrelated research chores and hypotheses. 

**Interventions are conscious DISCHARGE PHENOMENA.**
