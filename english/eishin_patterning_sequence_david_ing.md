# “Creating Order of” vs “Negotiating Order with”

David Ing has an interesting way of looking at design process base on pattern language he introduce a distinction between # “Creating Order of” vs “Negotiating Order with”.

The two frames – of Creating Order Of, and Negotiating Order With – have histories: the former has been associated primarily with the domains of built physical environments, while the latter is associated with sociological organization of work.

- *Creating Order Of* Originates From Organizing Physical Geometric Structures
- *Negotiating Order With* Originates From Organizing Non-material Interactive Processes

In summary:

“Creating Order of” is a way of looking at the aspect of physical structure arragements/patterns.

“Negotiating Order with” is a way of looking for what happens in the social arrangements around the building process.

“Creating Order of” more aligned to the A Pattern Language book, whereas “Negotiating Order with” is
more aligned with The Timeless Way book.


## Eishin generative sequence, summarized by David Ing

0. Interview on hopes and dreams
1. Make a “poetic vision” as first sketch of a pattern language
2. Make the rudimentary pattern language physically coherent
3. Refine the language through discussions
4. Obtain approval of the pattern language
5. Renegotiate pattern language with space and money within budget
6. Find systems of centers in (i) the pattern language, and (ii) the places in the land. Combine
them.
7. Adjust the site plan on the site itself (not on models)



## Table 2: 1985 Eishin Project – Creating Order Of, Negotiating Order With
- Frame of Reference Activities Creating Order Of
-Frame of Reference Negotiating Order With –

1. Interview on hopes and dreams 
- Rough pattern language draft text of site placement and buildings 
- Engagement interviewing students, teachers, administrators
2. Make a “poetic vision” as first sketch of a
pattern language 
- Preliminary architectural text of campus precincts, streets, yard, great hall,
buildings, lawn 
- Meaning and expressions of intent
conveyed by teachers, staff and students
3. Make the rudimentary pattern language
physically coherent 
- Not-to-scale drawing of patterns, with seven principles ensuring completeness of the language 
- Visual representation reflecting inclusion of features from the dreams of interviewees
4. Refine the language through discussions 
- Refinement and further detailing of the pattern language text 
- Discussions with constituents confirming concerns have been addressed
5. Obtain approval of the pattern language 
- Eight key centers, 110 patterns 
- Acceptance that architects have appreciated concerns and interests
6. Renegotiate pattern language with space
and money within budget 
- Trimmed estimate of (i) indoor built space, and (ii) outdoor coverage of land, within the constraints of physical boundaries and financial constraints 
- Participation in reallocation of spaces to
conform to available resources, through tradeoff decisions (only increasing trimmed totals when decreasing elsewhere).
7. Find systems of centers in (i) the pattern
language, and (ii) the places in the land.
Combine them. 
- Geometric configuration of centers of the
pattern language into a feasible, coherent whole. 
- Realities of the land (e.g. ridge and
swamp) with abstractions of buildings yet to be constructed.
8. Adjust the site plan on the site itself (not
on models) 
- Surrogate visualizations (e.g. marks, flags) on the land to confirm pattern language 
- Progressive refinement of the pattern language into a physical reality
