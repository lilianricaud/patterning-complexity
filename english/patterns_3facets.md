We can envision the concept of pattern as a semiotic sign (Peirce 1903) with three facets (often confused with one another) that all come into play when we seek to understand a system or the world around us. These three facets are (1) the signs and cues that we notice in the environment (the ‘Object’ or system under observation in Peircean semiotic terms 16 ), (2) the inferences and mental models through which we make sense of and retain these cues which trigger and shape our decisions and actions (the ‘Interpretant’ in Peircean terms), and (3) the representations we create to describe and communicate about them (the ‘Representamen’ or ‘sign-vehicle’ in Peircean terms). This triadic definition of the pattern as semiotic sign corresponds to Kohls’ three ‘views of patterns’: **patterns in the world, patterns in our heads, and pattern descriptions**, and offers a coherent way to interconnect different kinds or instances of patterns.
