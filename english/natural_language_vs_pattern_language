# Vocabulary, Syntax, and Grammar: Linguistics and Design

In creating this system for architectural design, Alexander borrowed heavily from linguistics and mathematics. Indeed, he analogizes his pattern language to logical languages, which contain two features:
1. A set of elements, or symbols.
2. A set of rules for combining these symbols.

Alexander explains that natural languages, such as English, represent more a complex variation of this simple logical language.

The two elements are again present. A natural language consists of words and then rules that outline the permissible arrangements of words.

However, a natural language also defines the relationships between words. Alexander writes, “there is . . . a structure on t
he words —the complex network of semantic connections, which defines each word in terms of other words, and shows how words are connected to other words.”

Just as a natural language contains words and rules of grammar for creating sentences that make sense, so too an architectural pattern language contains both a vocabulary of patterns and syntax for combining those patterns to create buildings that make sense. Alexander finds direct analogues between the systems of natural languages and pattern languages:
Natural Language /Pattern Language
Words / Patterns
Rules of grammar and meaning which give connections [between words] / Patterns which specify connections between patterns
Sentences / Buildings and places

The individual patterns in Alexander’s works serve as the equivalent to a “vocabulary” or collection of words in a language. Alexander’s patterns describe particular design problems and solutions. Alexander’s work also contains a “syntax” or system to link together the individual 
patterns or vocabulary into longer, more complex descriptions of design solutions (that is, buildings, neighborhoods, and cities).
