# Vocabulary, Syntax, and Grammar: Linguistics and Design

In creating this system for architectural design, Alexander borrowed heavily from linguistics and mathematics. Indeed, he analogizes his pattern language to logical languages, which contain two features:
1. A set of elements, or symbols.
2. A set of rules for combining these symbols.

Alexander explains that natural languages, such as English, represent more a complex variation of this simple logical language.

The two elements are again present. A natural language consists of words and then rules that outline the permissible arrangements of words.

However, a natural language also defines the relationships between words. Alexander writes, “there is . . . a structure on t
he words —the complex network of semantic connections, which defines each word in terms of other words, and shows how words are connected to other words.”

Just as a natural language contains words and rules of grammar for creating sentences that make sense, so too an architectural pattern language contains both a vocabulary of patterns and syntax for combining those patterns to create buildings that make sense. Alexander finds direct analogues between the systems of natural languages and pattern languages:
Natural Language /Pattern Language
Words / Patterns
Rules of grammar and meaning which give connections [between words] / Patterns which specify connections between patterns
Sentences / Buildings and places

The individual patterns in Alexander’s works serve as the equivalent to a “vocabulary” or collection of words in a language. Alexander’s patterns describe particular design problems and solutions. Alexander’s work also contains a “syntax” or system to link together the individual 
patterns or vocabulary into longer, more complex descriptions of design solutions (that is, buildings, neighborhoods, and cities).

Alexander argues that this pattern language has a “generative” quality.
It provides individuals with conceptual building blocks and rules to design an infinite number of buildings. Alexander writes, “[A] pattern language . . . gives us the power to generate these coherent arrangements of space. Thus, as in the case of natural languages, the pattern language is generative. It not only tells us the rules of arrangement, but shows us how to construct arrangements —as many as 
we want—which satisfy the rules.” Alexander’s work thus builds directly off the linguistic theories of Noam Chomsky, who developed the idea that human languages possess a “generative grammar.”
