systems archetypes, documented by Peter Senge

The eight most common system archetypes are: 
1. Fixes  that  fail—A  solution  is  rapidly  implemented  to  address  the  symptoms  of  an  urgent 
problem. This quick fix sets into motion unintended consequences that are not evident at first 
but end up adding to the symptoms. 
2. Shifting the burden—A problem symptom is addressed by a short-term and a fundamental 
solution. The short-term solution produces side effects affecting the fundamental solution. As 
this occurs, the system’s attention shifts to the short-term solution or to the side effects. 
3. Limits to success—A given effort initially generates positive performance. However, over time 
the effort reaches a constraint that slows down the overall performance no matter how much 
energy is applied. 
4. Drifting  goals—As  a  gap  between  goal  and  actual  performance  is  realized,  the  conscious 
decision  is  to  lower  the  goal.  The  effect  of  this  decision  is  a  gradual  decline  in  the  system 
performance. 
5. Growth  and  underinvestment—Growth  approaches  a  limit  potentially  avoidable  with 
investments in capacity. However, a decision is made to not invest resulting in performance 
degradation, which results in the decline in demand validating the decision not to invest. 
6. Success to the successful—Two or more efforts compete for the same finite resources. The 
more  successful  effort  gets  a  disproportionately  larger  allocation  of  the  resources  to  the 
detriment of the others. 
7. Escalation—Parties  take  mutually  threatening  actions,  which  escalate  their  retaliation 
attempting to “one-up” each other. 
8. Tragedy of the commons 116 —Multiple parties enjoying the benefits of a common resource do 
not  pay  attention  to  the  effects  they  are  having  on  the  common  resource.  Eventually,  this 
resource is exhausted resulting in the shutdown of the activities of all parties in the system.
