# HIGH DEGREE OF ORGANIZED COMPLEXITY

An essential quality shared by all living cities is a high degree of organized complexity (Jacobs, 1961). The geometrical assembly of elements to achieve coherence results in a definite and identifiable urban morphology. It turns out that this morphology closely resembles that of traditional cities and towns: unplanned villages of many different cultures around the world; cities as they were before the middle of the nineteenth century; and to some degree, free squatter settlements. The morphology of a geometrically coherent system resembles planned twentieth-century cities the least of all. Contemporary rules for urban form, which reduce both complexity and connectivity in today's cities, are not capable of generating urban coherence.
