# Sequence for shaping part of a new town in greater frankfurt

1. identify the main spaces (in this case the T)
2. reshape these main space to strengthen them.
3. Work out tentative buildings volume to make these spaces stronger
4. Introduce inner spaces (gardens and courtyards) as the focus of the buildings
5. Make a model of space alone.
6. Add smaller passages, connecting the space and making it alive and varied
7. Establish the best orientation of minor centers (like the wide sidewalk and neck of the smaller street).
8. Fix the dimensions of the space (in relation to building heights which will be coming).
9. Reconfigure the buildings so as to intensify the system of spaces.
10. Grapple with buildings entrance positions, to support the spaces and the line of movement. Locate further smaller centers (the narrow neck, the gate, the wider mouth of the small street)
11. Make the interior plans of the buildings, fit the profiles and plans that have been evolved to strenghten the spaces.
12. Subdivide the interiors, to fit the irregular building plans.

Each of these steps was a structure-preserving step which forms or strenghtens centers.
